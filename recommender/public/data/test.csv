3,question,Tomcat - From HTTPS page to HTTP, in tomcat 8  i enabled tls connector for secure data transmission  and i created a security constraint in my web.xml. through the site menu  the user can go to a login page  or to the home page. upon arriving at the login page  as i have set the security constraint  the user's browser starts a tls communication. if the user clicks on the index menu (home)  he returns to the home page  but remains an https communication. and i do not know for what reason this is happening.     could someone tell me if this is a normal behavior of tomcat  and if there is any possibility (not mentioned in the  other answer  of another user - 2013) today (almost 2015) for this to be changed and the user returns to communicate via http? for what reason redirect https to http is a costly process? there is another way?    all that i find on the internet is about changing an http communication to https  but that's not what i'm looking for. i already know how to do that. i'm just avoiding that when communication change from http to https it stays in https even if the user try to access all the other pages of my application. i do not want that. it makes no sense for the user to access the home page with a https communication.    for me  it makes little sense tomcat react that way. for what reason tomcat do that? moreover  even if things are so  for what reason tomcat developers limit it at this point? do the web sites today do not allow it?     note : i am currently using spring mvc  tomcat 8.0.15  and eclipse luna service.    thank you for your time and attention.       i know that something very similar has already been asked here before:     tomcat - can i force non https?      please : notice that there are differences in my question. i ask the moderators to read it and interpret it before simply click the close button. furthermore  face the text as a whole  as all being the question. do not try to go out searching for the question mark (?). i'm showing a situation.  ,java web-services security tomcat ssl ,55,k3

10,question,Using digital signature to secure QR code," i was looking for something like \""inverted asymmetric cryptography\"" and came across a  great post   which actually covers what i need.   i want every user of my application has a public key allowing them to decrypt the message hidden in qr code which was encrypted with my private key. i want to make sure my system cannot be deceived by a fake qr code covering mine. accepted answer suggests using digital signature so i googled  java tutorial   showing how to use that feature.   here comes a little misunderstanting. i thought that using a digital signature  there would be a simple situation (let's call it a  ):       message is encrypted with private key   user reads encrypted message   user uses the public key to decrypt message.      however  my understanding is the digital signature works more like:      a digital signature is created using the private key and the message.   user needs the original message and the signature file.   user uses the digital signature to verify the message wasn't changed and comes from me.      am i right here? if so  how can i put both my message and signature in a qr code? things seemed pretty easy in case of   as i simply could encode the encrypted message using base64 and put the result in the qr code. however  it looks like i can't do the same thing without using tricks like  . how can i do so then?      oh  there is also an  answer from question \""qr code security\""  saying:        you can put anything you want in a qr code  including base-64 encoded bytes representing a signed document. no reader will know what to do with it; you'd have to write a custom app that scans and then knows to decode it and act accordingly.      according to the tutorial mentioned earlier it looks like the signed document itself is not enough though.

14,question,How many active users maximum does a Parse.com database allow on the free plan?, i am exploring parse.com and building a proof-of-concept web application using the parse.com data storage. i keep receiving a daily app stats email. that's ok  and i noticed one of my database applications had 8 active users and it reported 14% of monthly quote. i tried to search around parse.com for its meaning but didn't get anything.    my question is how many users at maximum a database can handle on the free plan? my app will have as many as 300+ users.  ,java parse.com ,80,k1
15,accepted-answer,How many active users maximum does a Parse.com database allow on the free plan?, my reading of the pricing and faq pages is that you are not accounted based on the number of users you have.  rather you are accounted based on your aggregate requests per second  file storage  database storage and data transfer.    the faq has this advice:        q: does requests per second roughly translate to # of concurrent users? i anticipate millions of users but i can't afford to pay $10m per month.        a: generally when your user count doubles  your requests per second also double. however  different apps send different numbers of requests per second depending on how frequently they save objects or issue queries. we estimate that the average app's active user will issue 10 requests. thus  if you had a million users on a particular day  and their traffic was evenly spread throughout the day  you could estimate your app would need about 10 000 000 total api requests  or about 120 requests per second. every app is different  so we strongly encourage you to measure how many requests your users send. you can see this in the performance analytics tab of your account.       so ....        my question is how many users at maximum a database can handle on the free plan? my app will have as many as 300+ users.      there is no limit the number of users  but if you have lots of simultaneous active users that is likely to translate into lots of requests per second.  the actual ratio depends on your application and what your users are doing.  that is impossible for us to predict.    however  if 8 active users takes about 15% of the allowed free usage  then a simple linear extrapolation says that are liable to need to start paying for capacity when you reach about 50 to 60 users.  but that is little better than a guess .... and it takes no account of how evenly the usage is spread over a typical 24 hour period.  ,java parse.com ,80,k1

29,question,How does java source code ultimately interact with files?, i have been wondering about how the java compiler/interpreter manages to provide an interaction between bytecode/source code and file input and output.     i understand that inputstream and outputstream are the super-classes of all file i/o classes  but after reading through them  they provide no implementation for the basic file interaction methods (read() and write(byte b)). my initial idea was that perhaps the compiler would translate these methods into certain bytecode operations (that return a byte from a file or write a byte to a file) that only occur in this instance  but this may not be correct.    if java were compiled to assembly  then i understand that a certain instruction would be translated into platform-specific file i/o code (e.g. cout &lt;&lt; ... in c)  but this is obviously (afaik) not the case with java since it's compiled to bytecode.    can anyone enlighten me?  ,java file-io bytecode ,50,k2
