   and the more important question is  how do i initialize a per-thread data? as part of my database connection managing  i am using a library which requires me to initialize data in each thread.     currently  i am checking a value on every call to that library  to know to initialize it. but i prefer to simply initialize it every time a thread starts.    i believe it should be possible; after all  someone is creating those threads that keep calling my spring controllers.    p.s. i am using the default servlet container in spring  which is tomcat. i also tried doing a quick search for per-thread initialization and multi-threading in tomcat  but couldn't find any clear information on when a new thread actually spawn  or some information about a thread pool being used. i could be wrong though  and the multi threading is   ","code":null,"user_id":4086075.0,"time":1419978832,"vote":0,"reputation":30,"accept_rate":43,"tag":"java multithreading spring-mvc tomcat servlet-container ","id":"d5da35d62190ca96d9d2ebd8a734d2ac69e980ed"}", "q_sim": 0.23505, "t_sim": 0.57157}}, {"932b09449332f895e846484658eecff83f45b3fe": {"answer": ["{"type":"question","title":"Convert a List&lt;Object&gt; to List String","content":"<pre><code>Query  w=em.createQuery(\\\\SELECT ar.authorId.firstName \\\\n                        count(ar) FROM Article ar\\\\n                        WHERE ar.categoryId.categoryText=:\\\\n                                                 categoryText GROUP BY ar.authorId\\\\\\"); \\\\n       w.setParameter(\\\\\\"categoryText\\\\\\"  categoryText); \\\\n\\\\n       List list1=w.getResultList();  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n       System.out.println(list1.toString());\\\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Whats the wrong. i get <code>[[Ljava.lang.Object;@60a19573  [Ljava.lang.Object;@44a085e5]<\\/code><\\/p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I want to print the query like \\\\\\"name:\\\\\\"+firtname+\\\\\\"Articles:\\\\\\"+count(ar)<\\/p>\\\\n\\"","text":"      whats the wrong. i get      i want to print the query like \\\\\\"name:\\\\\\"+firtname+\\\\\\"articles:\\\\\\"+count(ar)  ","code":"query  w=em.createquery(\\\\\\"select ar.authorid.firstname                          count(ar) from article ar                         where ar.categoryid.categorytext=:                                                  categorytext group by ar.authorid\\\\\\");         w.setparameter(\\\\\\"categorytext\\\\\\"  categorytext);          list list1=w.getresultlist();            system.out.println(list1.tostring());  [[ljava.lang.object;@60a19573  [ljava.lang.object;@44a085e5] ","user_id":4405935.0,"time":1419978690,"vote":0,"reputation":3,"accept_rate":0,"tag":"java ","id":"932b09449332f895e846484658eecff83f45b3fe"}"], "question": "{"type":"question","title":"Convert a List&lt;Object&gt; to List String","content":"<pre><code>Query  w=em.createQuery(\\\\SELECT ar.authorId.firstName \\\\n                        count(ar) FROM Article ar\\\\n                        WHERE ar.categoryId.categoryText=:\\\\n                                                 categoryText GROUP BY ar.authorId\\\\\\"); \\\\n       w.setParameter(\\\\\\"categoryText\\\\\\"  categoryText); \\\\n\\\\n       List list1=w.getResultList();  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n       System.out.println(list1.toString());\\\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Whats the wrong. i get <code>[[Ljava.lang.Object;@60a19573  [Ljava.lang.Object;@44a085e5]<\\/code><\\/p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I want to print the query like \\\\\\"name:\\\\\\"+firtname+\\\\\\"Articles:\\\\\\"+count(ar)<\\/p>\\\\n\\"","text":"      whats the wrong. i get      i want to print the query like \\\\\\"name:\\\\\\"+firtname+\\\\\\"articles:\\\\\\"+count(ar)  ","code":"query  w=em.createquery(\\\\\\"select ar.authorid.firstname                          count(ar) from article ar                         where ar.categoryid.categorytext=:                                                  categorytext group by ar.authorid\\\\\\");         w.setparameter(\\\\\\"categorytext\\\\\\"  categorytext);          list list1=w.getresultlist();            system.out.println(list1.tostring());  [[ljava.lang.object;@60a19573  [ljava.lang.object;@44a085e5] ","user_id":4405935.0,"time":1419978690,"vote":0,"reputation":3,"accept_rate":0,"tag":"java ","id":"932b09449332f895e846484658eecff83f45b3fe"}", "q_sim": 0.9491, "t_sim": 0.12829}}, {"cf8aacca64d49d3d479bbee9012b1f40cd3529ed": {"answer": ["{"type":"question","title":"Error in volley android sample code","content":"<p>I am getting an error in this sample code from the android developer training.
