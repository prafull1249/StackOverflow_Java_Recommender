Without using any hash maps or changing the structure of my code too much (I can't change the signature of findMatchingElements())  is there a way to minimize the number of comparisons that my method makes  in order to construct the new array of shared elements?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Sure. Your nested loops have complexity of <code>O(m*n)</code>. When you create a temporary <code>HashMap</code>  you can reduce it to <code>O(m+n)</code> and gain a lot for big inputs. From practical POV  somewhere around length of 10 it should get faster than your solution.</p>\\n\\n<p>I'm giving no code as it's too straightforward.</p>\\n","tag":"java arrays string performance comparison ","accept_rate":74,"time":1413365523,"vote":0,"type":"answer","id":"3d39bf557822ecbaed477f7ff895184083aacb01","reputation":15160}],"question":{"code":"string findmatchingelements() remove() import java.util.*;  public class commonelements {      int originalcollectioncount = 0;       object[] originalcollections;         int listcount = 1;     int matchcount;     int comparisoncount = 0;                      public comparable[] findmatchingitems(object[] collections)     {             string[] queryarray = (string[])collections[0];          string[] secondaryarray = (string[])collections[1];          arraylist&lt;string&gt; querylist = new arraylist(arrays.aslist(queryarray));         arraylist&lt;string&gt; secondarylist = new arraylist(arrays.aslist(secondaryarray));         arraylist&lt;string&gt; commonlist = new arraylist();                 int  i = 0;          if(listcount == 1){               originalcollectioncount = collections.length;             originalcollections = collections;         }          listcount ++;                                         for(string x:querylist)         {                         for(string y:secondarylist)             {                                       comparisoncount++;                                  if(x.compareto(y) == 0)                 {                      commonlist.add(x); //add mutually shared item to commonlist                     secondarylist.remove(y); //remove mutually shared item from consideration                     if(originalcollectioncount == listcount) //if every list has been examined                     {                         system.out.println(commonlist.get(i));                                                                         }                     i++;                       break;                 }             }         }          string[] commonlistresult = new string[commonlist.size()];         commonlist.toarray(commonlistresult);                     if(originalcollectioncount &gt; listcount){              findmatchingitems(new object[] {commonlistresult originalcollections[listcount]});}          if (collections.length == 0) {             return new comparable[0];         } else if (collections.length == 1) {             return (comparable[]) collections[0];         }                         return commonlistresult;     }      public int getcomparisons(){         return comparisoncount;}         }       public class testrun {  private final static string[] collection_5_1 = {\\\"pittsburgh\\\"  \\\"new york\\\"  \\\"chicago\\\"  \\\"cleveland\\\"  \\\"miami\\\"  \\\"dallas\\\"  \\\"atlanta\\\"  \\\"detroit\\\"}; private final static string[] collection_5_2 = {\\\"dallas\\\"  \\\"atlanta\\\"  \\\"cleveland\\\"  \\\"chicago\\\"  \\\"washington\\\"  \\\"houston\\\"  \\\"baltimore\\\"  \\\"denver\\\"}; private final static string[] collection_5_3 = {\\\"chicago\\\"  \\\"kansas city\\\"  \\\"cleveland\\\"  \\\"jacksonville\\\"  \\\"atlanta\\\"  \\\"tampa bay\\\"  \\\"dallas\\\"  \\\"seattle\\\"};       public static void main(string[] args) {         new testrun();            }      public testrun() {          commonelements commonelements = new commonelements();                          object[] input = new object[3];         input[0] = collection_5_1;         input[1] = collection_5_2;         input[2] = collection_5_3;              system.out.println(\\\"matching items:\\\");         commonelements.findmatchingitems(input);          system.out.println(commonelements.comparisoncount + \\\" comparisons made.\\\");          } }  ","user_id":4128182,"title":"Reducing the number of comparisons performed when matching between two String arrays","text":" i am comparing three arrays of  s using the two classes below. without using any hash maps or changing the structure of my code too much (i can't change the signature of  )  is there a way to minimize the number of comparisons that my method makes  in order to construct the new array of shared elements?     in testrun.java i tested my code on three arrays with 8 elements each  which resulted in 46 comparisons made. i want to achieve a lower number of comparisons. is there a way?     i tried using the   method to remove a string from the collection once it was successfully compared to a matching element from the query collection. that prevented some redundant comparisons  but it did not result in a significant reduction.
