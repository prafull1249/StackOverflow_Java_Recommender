My understanding of this method after looking at the source (JDK7)  is that the calling thread actually submits a Collection and afterwards acquires a takeLock()  which blocks other consumers. After that till the count of max elements  the items of the nodes are removed from the queue and put in a collection.</p>\\n\\n<p>What I could appreciate is that it saves the threads from acquiring locks again and again  but  pardon my limited knowledge  I could not appreciate the need for the same in real world examples. Could some one please share some real world examples where drainTo behavior is observable ?</p>\\n",

(this class is a synchronization barrier like mutexes and latches  but more flexible and powerful.) so synchronizing with a   inside a   task should use managed blocking and can avoid starvation deadlocks (but   is still preferable because it uses work stealing instead of managed blocking). this works regardless of whether you use the   directly or via its   interface. however  it will not work if you use any other   like those created by the class    because these do not support managed blocking.    in scala  the use of managed blocking is more widespread ( description    api ).

          "content": "<p>You are almost answering your own question. The solution is the statement that \\<code>ForkJoinPool</code> avoids this problem by stealing work from other threads from inside the <code>join()</code> call\\\". Whenever the threads are blocked for some other reason except <code>ForkJoinPool.join()</code>  this work stealing does not occur  and the threads just waits and does nothing.</p>\\n\\n<p>The reason for this is that in Java it is not possible for the <code>ForkJoinPool</code> to prevent its threads from blocking and instead give them something else to work on. The thread <em>itself</em> needs to avoid blocking and instead ask the pool for work it should do. And this is only implemented in the <code>ForkJoinTask.join()</code> method  not in any other blocking method. If you use a <code>Future</code> inside a <code>ForkJoinPool</code>  you will also see the starvation deadlock.</p>\\n\\n<p>Why is work stealing only implemented in <code>ForkJoinTask.join()</code> and not in any other blocking methods in the Java API? Well  there are many of such blocking methods (<code>Object.wait()</code>  <code>Future.get()</code>  any of the concurrency primitives in <code>java.util.concurrent</code>  I/O methods etc)  and they have nothing to do with <code>ForkJoinPool</code>  which is just an arbitrary class in the API  so adding special cases to all these methods would be bad design. It would also lead to possibly very surprising and undesired effects. Imagine for example a user passing a task to an <code>ExecutorService</code> that waits on a <code>Future</code>  and then finding out that the task hangs very long in <code>Future.get()</code> just because the running thread stole some other (long-running) work item instead of waiting for the <code>Future</code> and continuing immediately after the result is available. Once a thread starts working on another task  it cannot return to the original task until the second task is finished. Thus it is actually a good thing that other blocking methods do not do work stealing. For a <code>ForkJoinTask</code>  this problem does not exist  because it is not important that the primary task is continued as soon as possible  it is only important that all tasks together are handled as efficiently as possible.</p>\\n\\n<p>It is also not possible to implement your own method for doing work stealing inside a <code>ForkJoinPool</code>  because all the relevant parts are not public.</p>\\n\\n<p>However  there is actually a second method how starvation deadlocks can be prevented. This is called <strong>managed blocking</strong>. It does not use work stealing (to avoid the problem mentioned above)  but also needs the thread that is going to be block to actively cooperate with the thread pool. With managed blocking  the thread tells the thread pool that it may be blocked <em>before</em> it calls the potentially blocking method  and also informs the pool when the blocking method is finished. The thread pool then knows that there is a risk of a starvation deadlock  and may spawn additional threads if all of its threads are currently in some blocking operation and there are still other tasks to execute. Note that this is less efficient than work stealing  because of the overhead of the additional threads. If you implement a recursive parallel algorithm with ordinary futures and managed blocking instead of with <code>ForkJoinTask</code> and work stealing  the number of additional threads can get very large (because in the \\\"divide\\\" phase of the algorithm  a lot of tasks will be created and given to threads that immediately block and wait for results from sub-tasks). However  a starvation deadlock is still prevented  and it avoids the problem that a task has to wait a long time because its thread started working on another task in the mean time.</p>\\n\\n<p>The <code>ForkJoinPool</code> of Java also supports managed blocking. To use this  one needs to implement the interface <a href=\\\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker.html\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"><code>ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker</code></a> such that the potentially-blocking method that the task wants to execute is called from within the <code>block</code> method of this interface. Then the task may not call the blocking method directly  but instead needs to call the static method <a href=\\\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.html#managedBlock-java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker-\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"><code>ForkJoinPool.managedBlock(ManagedBlocker)</code></a>. This method handles the communication with the thread pool before and after the blocking. It also works if the current task is not executed within a <code>ForkJoinPool</code>  then it just calls the blocking method.</p>\\n\\n<p>The only place I have found in the Java API (for Java 7) that actually uses managed blocking is the class <a href=\\\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Phaser.html\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"><code>Phaser</code></a>. (This class is a synchronization barrier like mutexes and latches  but more flexible and powerful.) So synchronizing with a <code>Phaser</code> inside a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> task should use managed blocking and can avoid starvation deadlocks (but <code>ForkJoinTask.join()</code> is still preferable because it uses work stealing instead of managed blocking). This works regardless of whether you use the <code>ForkJoinPool</code> directly or via its <code>ExecutorService</code> interface. However  it will not work if you use any other <code>ExecutorService</code> like those created by the class <code>Executors</code>  because these do not support managed blocking.</p>\\n\\n<p>In Scala  the use of managed blocking is more widespread (<a href=\\\"http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html#blocking\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">description</a>  <a href=\\\"http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.concurrent.package@blocking[T](body:=%3ET):T\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">API</a>).</p>\\n\"",
