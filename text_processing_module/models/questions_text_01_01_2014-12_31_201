 i have an issue with the acm library. i am trying to create a game. in order to get the applet running in acm you need to make use of the run() method of a graphicsprogram class.    i have a separate class  which has this graphics program as a global field  adding and removing elemnts from the graphical interface. my problem is that if i have a while loop inside this class  the graphics program stops working properly (cannot remove elements  cannot access it from an outside menu...).    is there any acm expert that knows how to have infinitely many iterations of a while loop together with a working graphicsprogram?    i have:         i cannot move the code from battle into controller because controller is more complex than the code given.  
 i have made a class called   which simply holds some   and   integers. i want to use this as a key for a  .    however  i noticed that when you create two different instances of   with the same   and   values  they are used as different keys by the hash map. that is  you can put two entries even though both of them have the same coordinates.    i have overriden  :         but the   still uses the two instances as if they were different keys. what do i do?    and i know i could use an integer array of two elements instead. but i want to use this class.

 what i want from the following minimum working example is to change its radio button's text twice in a small time interval after clicking on it. i.e.  when i click on the button  i want to immediately change its text to \"1\" and after 3 seconds to change its text again to \"2\".          the above obviously doesn't work.     i know that i should use repaint() or swingutilities.invokelater() or maybe a new thread in some way  but i didn't manage yet to achieve the desired result with any combination of the them.    what should i do?     thanks in advance.  
 i have an activity in which when on its oncreate() state will executes a backgroundtask (asynctask) that will return some data to the activity when its finished executing. when the data is received the activity adds a listfragment to itself through a fragmenttransaction. the data received will be passed to the listfragment for its adapter usage.    the issue is while the background task is running and then the screen orientation changes  the moment when the onpostexecute passes a data back to the activity and the activity tries to add the listfragment the application crashes with the below error.     java-lang-illegalstateexception-can-not-perform-this-action-after-onsaveinstance     then i tried using      with this i receive the error below     activiy has been destroyed     please how else can i handle this flow process such that the screen orientation change doesn't crash the application.    note that without a change in the screen orientation everything works perfect. it only gets worse when there is a screen orientation change between when the activity is waiting for the background task to execute completely with its response data.

 i wanted to do a little farming game and started to write classes for resources and crops. but when i initialize my resource at the beginning it gives me an identifier expected error.by the way dont mind the german comments. :d         at itemwheat = new resource(1 \"wheat\" true 100); i get an error behind the itemwheat that says identifier expected and i couldnt find a reason to it.  
 given an example from the book of vaadin ( chapter 5.21 table component  navigation in editable mode ):         actually the  navigator.addcompoent(table)  must be replaced with navigator.setcontent(table)  cause panel has not an  addcomponent  method  but this is not the point.    the point is that i have noticed that using a custom shortcut action handler lowers the performance of the focus change from a field to the next one when you hold down the action key. the reason of this is because when using this custom handler implementation  vaadin makes a request every time one of the shortcut keys is typed (in this example  when tab  shift+tab  arrow_up  arrow_down and enter are typed).    this gives the following result:         starting from the \"numeric field\" with value \"0\" i have typed tab two times and at the same time two requests were made to the server.    in contrast  if using no custom shortcut action handler  the previous two tabs would result into this:         no unnecessary requests. this is not a problem while the typing is slow  but as i said before  if you hold down the tab key  hundreds requests will be made  and you will notice the difference. enhancing the user experience allowing the user easily navigate through the table fields here has a cost in performance from this point of view.    so my question is  is there a way to disable this unnecessary requests when using a custom shortcut action handler in vaadin?  
 classes can be added to an android project in eclipse via new -> class  and this will supposedly add it to the project somehow  but how can i do this via the command line? i set up the class in src/(reverse.dns.path)/class.java  but i couldn't find anything in  http://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-cmdline.html   but i would appreciate any guidance  
 suppose i have a class name  employee          now i create subclass based on their position         if i want to access the empid and name of manager from manager class  how can i do that as those fields are private? i was thinking in the getter function in manager class  i would do super.getname() and super.getid()?     if there is anything wrong in class design pattern  please let me know. i want to make it as perfect as it can be. thanks for help.  
 i have created an asynctask class which gets called from my oncreate(...) method to connect to googleapiclient :         the asynccall class is (inside my activity class) :         the above used functions are (all are outside asynccall class but inside my activity class):          my activity class also implements googleapiclient.connectioncallbacks and               googleapiclient.onconnectionfailedlistener    googleapiclient on successful connection calls onconnected(bundle arg) function which my activity overrides.    my problem is that when i call googleclientinitialize() function from my oncreate(...) method  i receive a call to onconnected(..) function as expected. but when googleclientinitialize() is called from onpostexecute in asynccall class (as shown above)  no call is made to onconnected(..) function. i don't know why (nothing is printed in trace files) ?? i need to make call to onconnected(..) from onpostexecute(..)  it is the bottleneck of my code. plz help ??  
 i'm having trouble making my dropdown menus multiply. i know it has to do with referencing the id's to the correct function. my aim is to create a form which will multiply the number of days (giving a certain factor to the value eg. 0 days = 1.5) with the value for a certain number of slabs (1 slab and 2 slabs=250 3 and 4=500 etc.). after that i wanted to multiply the number of slabs by 100 and add 100 to the end result. to break it down it would look like this: (days factor*number of slabs)+((number of slabs*100)+100) this i wanted to show in a read only text box.

 i'm using lightadmin  http://lightadmin.org/  crud framework in my spring mvc project. i was searching the way to override the \"delete method\" because i want to do a \"soft delete\"   i have a field in my entities called \"deleted\". when i press delete button   really delete the row in my database   i want change that behavior to do a update   and set the deleted field to true.    i was searching in the official documentation and i found this :  http://lightadmin.org/getting-started/registering-repository-event-listeners/    but when the method on the listener its executed   finally the row is deleted in the database. i would like stop the execution to prevent the delete action. i'm doing a \"return\" but not working. this is my listener.    probably the framework lightadmin was a bad choice  but i need a framework like this. do you know one?? thanks to all !!!!!       
 i am implementing a fairly simplistic plugin system for my application. plugins are kept as .jar files in a separate folder. i've looked at many examples on how to load resources from other jar files  but i have never gotten it to work.    the 'description' is a file containing basic info about the plugin that needs to be read before the classes in the jar are loaded.       
 i'm creating a world generator for my 2d game  which uses the diamond-square algorithm in java  and i've heard that it only works (or at least  only works well) with numbers that are 2 n +1 (power of two).    the method that generates the world is called with    but that creates a problem. i want to be able to input a    and the function will find the nearest number which  is  a power of two  if the input width isn't. i don't really know how i can do this  so all help is greatly appreciated!     summarizing : if one number isn't power of two  i want to find the nearest number to that one  which  is  a power of two.  
 i just started to develop a java web application based on the ninjaframework. everything works great  but: with all the ninja-dependencies  the deploy-war has around 25mb. i really hope  i won't have to upload a 25mb java archive all the time - especially due to the fact  that the dependencies won't barely change as often as e.g. a stylesheet of my app.    is there a practical solution to move the ninjaframework-dependencies to a separated jar? i am working with eclipse  therefore a solution that integrates in the ide would be great.    so far  i have had a look into the maven dependency-scoping and have (unsuccessfully) tried to move the dependencies into a separated project and refer to the project with a system-scoped dependency (which i would in my understanding be able to deploy as a separated jar file). i currently fail at building this dependency-jar with maven - but i also wonder  if there are better approaches.    i deploy the application on a tomcat-server in a plesk installation  
 i have some trouble with my gauss jordan elimination method. it looks a bit oversimplified but on paper it should work. it sets the pivot to 1 considering that in case of 0 it must perform a swap. then it subtracts that row times the value conindex  of the remaing rows with the same index number of the pivot column.    i use these methods in my final algorithm.    row multiplication:         dividing rows:         row subtraction:         pivot check and row swap:         and then my final gauss jordan algorithm:         how ever if i give it this matrix to compute.         it somehow skips the middle column of the square 3 x 3 matrix on the left and returns.         the expected outcome is:         can somebody help me with finding that what i must have overlooked. i just hope its nothing to obvious! i thank you for your trouble.

 i wrote a node class whose 'data' field is designed to hold any type of data and a linked list class designed to hold nodes with any type of data. i was implementing a class to delete duplicates (\"deleteduplicates\") and found myself having trouble setting the tail to null (\"deleting the tail\") of my linked list and i feel like it's because i'm trying to set a class to null. what am i not understanding? i was hoping someone could correct my thinking. specifically see my commented out code todo on line 116 in the method deleteduplicates.

 i have a android webview object where i want to display data from a html string which can contain images too. is it possible to load the text first and let the webview download and display the images afterwards? at the moment the text gets displayed as soon as the images are downloaded too.          edit:  i have no idea why  but after adding the line         it suddenly worked the way i wanted.     edit2:  i was wrong it is still  not working  correctly. this strange behaviour does not occur always  but regularly enough for it to be really annoying.

 i am working on a very simple mind mapping application  and i use a jpanel to draw the structure of the mind map on. the nodes of the mind map are circles  and if you write in a node  the structure expands in that direction. i put my jpanel in a jscrollpane  but my problem is  that i can only expand it downwards  or to the right  but it should be expandable to the left and upwards as well. when my jscrollpane should expand in \"negative directions\" so upwards or to the left  i tried calculating how many coordinates i shift  and than redrawing the whole graphic  changing the x and y coordinates of everything respectively. but it still did not work  it drew the part that is visible correctly  but then when i scrolled down  the rest of my drawing disappeared.    i hope there is a solution for this  because i've searched for hours and found nothing useful  and because i can't think of any other way to solve this. thank you for your help! :)  
 i am running the following program in java (through eclipse ide):         while the program runs  i am trying to see the thread activity in jvisualvm. i was expecting to see both the threads in green concurrently (i.e. running concurrently)  however i see that at any point in time during execution  for a little while any one thread is in the monitor state  while the other is being executed. after a little while  they switch (the former is executing  while the latter is in monitor state). how can this be?

 i'm just start working with spring 4. i want to setup spring 4 mvc project with java configuration. i use intellij idea 13.1.6. first i create new spring 4 mvc project from spring mvc 3.2 template. then i add my java spring configuration files but when i run app its shows \"hello world\" from hello template controller instead of my home controller. here is my project structure:         and here is my project files:    hellocontroller:         rootconfig:         spittrwebappinitializer:         homecontroller:         mvc-dispatcher-servlet.xml:         web-app.xml:         spitter.iml:         why this code dont run home controller but hello controller insdead and how can i fix it?    i suspect that there is something wrong with spitter.iml file and spring see only web.xml configuration instead of java class configuration.

 i have an app that i need search engine crawlers to be able to index.  i don't need that the whole app to be indexed just specific url (or url pattern) like   where   is a hash code  similar to those url shorteners out there.      my app works like this:     when that url is accessed  the servlet will forward the request to a gwt app passing this fragment:      so the view page is totally dynamic.     the question is what is the correct way to make this specific dynamically generated url to be indexed or crawled by search engines?  
 i would like to know the reason why byte and short values are promoted to int when an expression is evaluated or a bitwise operation is processed?  
 i have a   that i'm trying to add an autocompletion menu to. but i'm having issues with how i should handle the focus.    here's a  sscce          of course there's more logic to it in the real program  but the issue i'm having is that i want to show the autocompletion dialog/menu  but still be able to continue typing in the text field. at the same time  i also want to be able to navigate the menu with the up/down arrows and the enter key  as well as with the mouse  to select one of the completion options.    can someone please help me with how i should proceed here? thanks!     edit:     thanks to  @camickr 's reply i played around a bit with   together with an inputmap/actionmap to always keep the focus in the text field  and manually control the selected list item. the problem is that you get a visual difference when doing it that way compared to if the list had proper focus. see the screen shots.    this is what it looks like if i don't mess with the focus (this is what i want).         this is what it looks like if i run           the main differences are the highlight border (darker blue) around the selected list item  but also the blue highlight around the entire dialog. then there's also the differences in the title bar.    (don't mind the render artifacts  i'm connecting to a three year old virtual linux installation using an old nx client)     edit 2:     i was afraid that it was the look and feel or os that determined how the selected list item should look (with the highlighted border for example). but it turns out that it is indeed just the cell renderer that makes that call. knowing that i felt much better about writing my own cell renderer  and i now have a solution that i'm happy with.    this is the code i ended up using:       
 i want to create a jtable where each cell should be the size of a single character  without any separation between adjacent characters (i.e adjacent columns). there are no borders between columns so the visualization of a sequence of columns is indistinguible of a jlabel. i have tried many things like making the width of a column as small as possible until each cell is displayed as ... meaning there is no space to print the character. so say i want to have 5 consecutive cells to print the name alice. what i have achieved so far is a table with this aspect    a l i c e    if i make the column width smaller it shows    ... ... ... ... ...      and what i want is:    alice    thanks!!    alvaro

 i have a very basic jax-rs service (the   class below) which allows for the creation of entities of type   (also below).  ing the payload         successfully persists the   and returns  . however  including an   attribute with whichever non-null value on the payload triggers an   with the message  .  i understand what this means   and including an   on the payload when creating an object (in this case) makes no sense. however  i'd prefer to prevent this exception from bubbling all the way up and present my users with  for instance  a   in this case (or  at least  ignore the attribute altogether). however  there are two main concerns:      the exception that arrives at   is an   and i'd have to crawl all the way down the stack trace to discover the root cause;   the root cause is   - i'm deploying to wildfly which uses hibernate  but i want to maintain my code portable  so i don't really want to catch this specific exception.      to my understanding  there are two possible solutions:      use   before  . this would ignore the fact that the   attribute carries a value and proceed with the request.   check if   and throw something like   that could be mapped to a   status code. seems the preferable solution.      however  coming from other frameworks (like django rest framework  for example) i'd really prefer this to be handled by the framework itself... my question then is  is there any built-in way to achieve this behaviour that i may be missing?    this is the   class:         this is the   class:         this is the   class:

 ok  off the bat  i know this question either sounds like common sense  or very confusing due to its wording. unfortunately  due to my lack of knowledge even after much research  i am unsure how to phrase it. to my understanding at this point  static variables do not refer to an instance of a class  and a class.method call is used to access them. variables declared non-static and public are instances of the class and can be called using an object.method call. however  in recent examples  i have seen statements such as:         why not just write         how is this possible? i thought that static variables were  not associated with instances of classes ?  i am just very confused regarding the meaning and limitations/usages of static versus non-static.  i apologize for any confusion. if this question deems unanswerable  a link providing an example of simple differentiation between static and public usage would be greatly appreciated. i am a complete beginner so please avoid using too much technical jargon. thanks in advance.

 i have used eclipse in the past for different projects  most lately openoffice plugin development. i want to start developing apps for devices running android  so i downloaded the android developer studio (ads). i see that it's obviously an independent distribution of eclipse  and that's ok  but i would prefer to use only one eclipse to write all my  java   etc. applications.    what are the preferred use guidelines to only use either one of the ides for both android development and other java development?  
 does anybody know how to move \"on the ones\" and change them to 2? i think we need recursion  but i'm not very good at it  so i'm asking you for help.    you can only move up  down  left or right.    here is an example:       
 i have been reading thinking in java from bruce eckel these days  when comes to the access control chapter  it says if a java file has two or more classes  except the public one  others can not be   (that would make it inaccessible to anyone but the class) or  .    but i have seen a lot of popular java libraries and open source projects did have used private to decorate these kind of classes.    so is it because the book too theoretical or any reason else?    the original text (page 231  forth edition)        note that a class can not be private (that would make it inaccessible to anyone but the class) or protected. so you have only two choices for class acess: package acces or public. if you don`t want anyone else to have access to that class  you can make all the constructors private  thereby preventing anyone but you  inside a static member of the class  form creating an object of that class.    
 i would like to set up the following (rough) scenario    a database/storagefile storing data of events and activities occurring within those events a (ideally java) map-reduce algorithm to be applied on those datasets to obtain the required data a rest api too allow external access to the results from the previous algorithm    [i know that my dataset will not be really large  however this is a proof of concept]    i have set up an hdinsight cluster from my azure portal however do not know how i should progress next.      how can i save structured data to my storage space? (if this is not a database)   how can i connect to that data from the map reduce application (if it is not a standard file. i am following  this  otherwise)      i am finding some information regarding this issues however it is outdated on windows azure which has changed substantially. i would also like to not use powershell as i would simply need the java code running for automatic execution.  
 in my remoteserviceimpl (gwt) i would return an arraylist. the model has a few members referencing to other objects which are also persistable. the whole object tree comes from gae datastore. i have to detach the objects before returning them in remoteserviceimpl. unfortunately after invoking pm.detachcopy() the nested information is lost which was previously present.         getter and setter present just omitted for brevity. after detaching the field waterconditions is not null but it contains nothing all members for example \"ph\" are null.    what i am do wrong in my case?  
 i am using a typical   ->   relationship with my application.  i am taking advantage of neo4j's ability to add metadata on the relationship through the relationshipentity annotation.  for some unexplained reason the role's properties are being 'nulled' out when i persists my relationship.    here's my user         role         relationshipentity         roletype (used in  )          when populating the relationship with a user and role  all the data is set.  however when i persists it the role's data is now null.         any ideas as to why this is occurring to my role object?     also  here are my repos       
 i have nullpointerexception problem on following code:         and there are users who report following crash on my google play dev console:         maybe i'm missing something out about how java/android works. can someone can explain why/how created objects can be destroyed in middle of active activity? even if check statement returns that the object isn't null?    the crash report count isn't big comparing to daily active user count  but still it's indicate the problem and obviously crash app on some users. also it's not device specific problem and i get reports from devices such: galaxy s4  nexus 4  galaxy s5  xperia z1 etc.     no matter how hard i try i can't create such situation on my devices or emulators.

 i have a web application from a vendor with some new functionality where you press a button on the webpage and it opens a new popup window to use the new functionality.  however  when a user who is logged into the application presses the button  the user is automatically logged out.  we have tested this with a lot of users and they all are having the same issue.      we are using ie 8 as that is what the vendor has written the application for.  the application is hosted on websphere application server 8.5.5.1 (which was just upgraded from websphere 7.0.17).  the issue happens whether or not we go through a web server or directly into the application via port number.    if i use google chrome however  the first time a user logs in and clicks the button  they are logged out  but the next time they log in the button works fine.  but we can't use google chrome as it's not supported by the vendor.    i've opened a pmr with ibm and they can see the session is getting invalidated.             we see a request for /blue2web/images/cbf/bg.grad.blue.jpg.  the request enters the filter springsecurityfilterchain  and the session is invalidated.    the request continues through several more filters (starting with the struts2 filter) and eventually returns a 304 response.      the vendor has said that nobody else (including them) has seen this issue.      i'm totally confused now  as i don't know if it's an ie 8 issue  spring issue  or websphere 8.5.5.1 issue.  we have other buttons in the application that bring up different windows for different functionality and they work just fine.      update (12/22/14) -      here is the trace from spring security.  not sure it will help.          update (12/24/14) -      ok  so the issue is occurring the spring security i believe.  when the application tries to get the images from /images/cbf  instead of picking the pattern /images/* it's picking the pattern / .  by picking the /  it's going through the spring security filters when it shouldn't be.  so why is it picking the pattern /** instead of /images/*.  could this be an issue in websphere 8.5.5.1?       here are the patterns it can choose.       
 i'm writing an image gallery with horizontal scrolling. images must be added programatically.  i use a custom horizontal scroll view to process and add images as in the following code:         as you can see i scale an image with use the following method (call  ):         my main.xml layout is pretty simple:          where the android.lessons.custom_horizontal_scroll.customhorizontalscrollview is implementation of a simple custom horizontalscrollview.    for testing i use samsung galaxy s3 and images with the following resolution: (1) 1290*990 (2) 1221*900. what it looks like:         in many cases everything is displayed fine but from time to time i get the wrong result: the first image divides a screen with the following one at app start time and i don't have any idea why it happens.    thanks for help.

 how to handle exceptions in java in functional way?     if i do:         and catching the exceptions  what should i return:      throw the exception?    else send some error code ( similar to how we handle in c languages )    because functional programming says:            a function should always return the same type.      given this scenario  it becomes for certain given input it will throw the exception. hence its not a pure functional style.     how one should handle this case in java?  
 my problem is that i am trying to import a 3d model from an stl file to a javafx application. i followed the code in this link  how to create 3d shape from stl in javafx 8?  and it's only working with the jewel file mentioned there  but i've tried with other stl files and it's not working!    i can't see why it's not working with the other files. can anyone explain this? any help please  as soon as possible!  
 here is my java code         if   is null  i want to print   without  . if   or any other param is null i want to skip it as well.    seams that it should be some tricky expression.     update     without   logic! only using expressions inside of   method.  
 i have a protootype of an app written using java swing  awt classes to do routine stuff such as allowing entry into a jtexfield along with jbutton(s) to allow selection from one of several values  and then to append selected button value into the jtexfield (so as to construct a mathematical equation). as a newbie to android  i am  struggling to map the resources in java swing to android equivalents. i want to use it's xml based capability to define the ui where possible and programatically to control behaviour. lokking for any advice on how to translate between these 2 frameworks.        
 where on earth are people storing their data when they are creating applications that runs in an clustered enviroment?    i have created an application that reads xslt's from an directory on the host. however if i want to run the same application in google cloud engine inside containers (docker) i have huge problems if i use services (load balancing). there must be a common data store that all reads/writes from. it should be mounted on each pod (right?).    what do i use for this? i tried to use hadoop but it is impossible to mount (all guides are outdated  i am running ubuntu 14.04).    i can't be the first man on earth trying to read/store data in a clustered environment. how is this done?   
 i am trying to save some data using xml in android to save into the devices internal storage.    i want to be sure the app is written by the  open/closed  and  single responsibility  -principle. (so i could easly switch between methods of storage)         this is my current structure ...    the problem i am facing now  is that in every tutorial about android and xml they use the function   i guess this is a function from activity superclass ?    how would i have to initialise my   and still keep my  open/closed  and  single responsibility   principle intact ?    should i pass an activity instance to my xmlappwriter constructor ? doesn't this undermine the  single responsibility   principle ?  
 i have a   and i want that when i get the   associated to a key and add some value to it.    the ternary operator makes    what i'm currently doing is checking if the value associated to the key foo is null  if it is then make a new arraylist add what i want to it and put it back into the map. if not  i store they arraylist add what i want to it and again put it back into the map.    i could do it like this:         but i prefer using the ternary operator to make my code a bit shorter:         my question is  (in the second) example am i executing   twice? or is the java compiler being smart and evaluating it only once? (i know it's a tiny difference in terms of execution speed but if it's executing twice it's enough of a reason for me to start using example 1)  
 i am developing a command handler where each command can have sub-commands indefinitely. all commands are managed at the root level by a \"commandmanager\" which takes user input parses options then finds the right command and passes the input to it. as both the commandmanager and the command both have a similar way of getting and storing specified commands and as both classes are very cluttered i would like to factor out the logic that finds and stores commands into a common superclass  however  i can't think of a descriptive name to call it.    the reason for me to try and make the commandmagager and the command both extend another class is that the command manager acts like a command at the root level. commands don't actually contain any logic to process commands  they just provide a way to register and retrieve commands with a certain name.    are there any general conventions that may help me find a name or is this the wrong way to be looking at the problem?

 say service calls dao class on which logging aspect(annotational)  needs to be applied. i am wondering how aspects actually gets applied.     as per my understanding at the time of dao injection under service object  spring finds out that there is some  aspect(in this case logging) is configured for dao  so it injects the proxy object instead of actual target object. ow when actual call is made to any method inside dao  proxy applies the aspects and then call the actual target object. is that correct ? also i believe this is called run time weaving.      on the other hand same can be done with load time weaving(with javaagent configuration) where byte code manipulation is done for classes on which aspects needs to be applied.  so proxy does not come into picture here.    please correct me if i am wrong as this is the foundation for all spring modules?

  question 1:     i am writing a program to use an absolute layout because i need to reposition a   at runtime. i have tried to understand the following java demo program (from oracle java tutorials):     http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/displaycode.html?code=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/examples/layout/absolutelayoutdemoproject/src/layout/absolutelayoutdemo.java     it suggests the following:         the frame is not set to be visible before the   values are calculated  so they are all   (zero)  am i getting it right?    i have tried to use   to replace the code and eclipse gives me the same result (the same window size as i have observed). is it wrong to have   before  ?     question 2:     in my own program  i have the following code segment:         a) is the above code segment in a  correct order  (i am a newbie of java's swing gui)?    b) i am using eclipse on my macbook pro to run java programs. i have 40  s (each with an  ) in a   in a  . if i use the above codes to generate the gui  it takes half a second to show all  s after the window is displayed. why aren't the jlabels shown at the same time the window is displayed?    any help will be appreciated. thank you so much for your time :)  
 so in a cellphone company i have few vectors of different class types  lets say:         i also have few interfaces that some of the classes implements. so i want to make a static function in the main class that will update a given \"updateable\" vector. it could be customer or employee  any vector which it's types can be updateable (implements the same interface). i did this:         that works  but i want to avoid the use of casting.. is there any way to apply this by any polymorphism way?

 by reading hibernate reference guide  i came across:    14.8. polymorphic queries    a query like:         returns instances not only of cat  but also of subclasses like domesticcat. hibernate queries may name any java class or interface in the from clause. the query will return instances of all persistent classes that extend that class or implement the interface. the following query would return all persistent objects:         the interface named might be implemented by various persistent classes:         note that these last two queries will require more than one sql select . this means that the order by clause does not correctly order the whole result set. (it also means you can't call these queries using query.scroll().)    so the question is  what will the last query return?         it going to be an array of all object that implement \"named\"  all has the same \"name\" value  and since it's a \"double request\"          does it mean the first half of the array will repeat itself in the second half?

 i always used setters as a place to validate a value before assigning it to a field.            what i think is good about it is that i now have one place where a value gets validated before assignment and i can call it from everywhere. but the compiler warns me about that overridable method call in the constructor of the class. i read  what&#39;s wrong with overridable method calls in constructors?  and understand the issues this might cause and that it is recommended to use a  builder pattern  instead. but would it be also okay to just add final to the getters and setters instead to prevent overriding those properties?

 please bear with me. i am quite new to maven and tried many solutions i gathered here but to no avail  unsuccessful.    i have previous enum called   in my project  together with other classes that make up a simple dialog functionality in my javafx project. recently i decided to recreate this feature into a separate library and published it in maven central.     i now deleted the previous enum and classes from my current project and applied the new dependency in my pom file:         this works well in importing other enums and class  but somehow the new   cannot be imported. it gives me cannot find symbol.    i tried using search maven repo feature in netbeans and it points me back to my library and if i click it nothing happens.    i also double check that enum class exist in my dependency folder.    i tried   but it didn't solve the problem.    i tried opening a new project and apply the dependency  but weirdly enough it does have the same problem.    i also tried reverting to v1.0.0 and works well on any project  but i need the latest version.    i tried typing the import code but resulted to cannot find symbol.    i also tried to use:          but it didn't solve it.    last night  it was working well when i created a new project. but today when i tried to apply this to my javafx project  it seems maven \"forgot\" about it.    is this because maven only remembers the previous enum? if so  how do i force maven to now point to the new enum in the library. (i have deleted the original enum in the project). to make it clear  only this enum is in question  the rest of library enum and classes can be imported.    here are more information:   - you check the library source code in here:  https://github.com/daytron/simpledialogfx   - apache maven 2.2.1 (rdebian-14)  - java version: 1.8.0_20  - java home: /usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_20/jre  - platform encoding: utf-8  - os name: \"linux\" version: \"3.13.0-36-generic\" arch: \"amd64\" family: \"unix\"

 okay  my game works fine. i recently added new difficulties. those work as well. now i'm banging my head on the wall to find out how to connect it all together. now the game wont be operated by the console when published  but this is testing so i'm making sure i can pull this off.    here's the gui of one of the difficulties (no game logic included):         if i connected this class to a basic window class  it would work perfectly. a basic window class meaning just a window that pops up waiting for something to feed in.    now  i am only going to present the window-scanner-opening logic with 1 mode so you can see what i mean:         whenever i run this more advanced screen class  i get  nothing .    any type of feedback would be appreciated.  
   i am not talking about the deprecated resume and suspend methods.   before i didn't use the synchronized keyword. i saw in a book that they used the synchronized keyword and i tried it and it worked perfectly. can you explain me why this approach works and not using synchronized doesn't? also why should while(suspendflag) loop should be in the synchronized block too?

 we have some timestamps represented as long in millis since epoch. within strings for logging  exceptions  or   methods  these timestamps need to be formatted. a simple and clean format is enough.    so  what is the simplest and fastest method for formatting a timestamp in java?    requirements:      input timestamps represented as long in millis since epoch   output should be a string   fast   low cg overhead   a simple and clean output is sufficient  since it is only for internal purposes (debugging and logging)  e.g. something minimal: 20141220 174522.23   if possible within jdk   the time zone is the system time zone      in particular  did somebody did a benchmark of jdk methods that can be used for this?    actually i don't want to use simpledateformat  since i believe its flexibility comes with too much overhead.

 i have an android app that should search in google using image.. user should upload photo and search using it..    i have that code to choose photo to search..         i searched in google  and i found only that..      imagesearch     but that searches for images using keyword.. i don't want that..    also i tried to search in bing using image but i couldn't.    any idea ?  
 i am writing a 2d strategy game and require to be able to display hundreds of images at one time.    so far i have many classes  but i have one dilemma as i fear i do not understand the   components well enough. i have written a smaller 3 class program to show my problem:    first i have a main class which constructs the frame:         currently the board class is the class which sits at the center of the program and pulls all of the strings to make the program run. previously all of the tutorials i have seen on the internet have pointed towards having the   method inside the board class  but this gives me the main dilemma. currently i have to type out manually every time i want something painted to the screen:         this method is repainted every few milliseconds and everything is great! except... now i have gotten to the point where i need hundreds of different elements painted to the screen at one time  from different classes and with this current method u have to type out manually each and every paint command  making the code ineffective and frankly pointless.    therefore i tried making a class that replaces the need of this manual labour  making the method reusable  but i am finding it extremely hard to make it work:         but how do i implement this class into my code  do i add it as a component? (and if so  how?) because i have tried this and it just throws an error at me  and i have tried using a few layouts but they just glitch up for some reason.    do i add them to panels? i have no idea how that would pan out..    other than that i am clueless as i have spent the whole day looking at this problem.  
 this question is related with my previous  question     i can successfully get the string in json format from the url to my spring controller    now i have to decode it    so i did like the following         this is the json string      when i run the code then i get the error         what wrong i am doing?  
 just a question about vaadin's table component. i have a table created with a tablefieldfactory  and i have noticed that if i count the number of times the tablefieldfactory is called for a table with e.g. 8 rows and 4 columns  i get 40 as the result (instead of the expected 8 * 4 = 32).     so does vaadin uses an hidden extra column when creating the table? does this column contain the itemid given to the table.additem() method? anyway here is the code i used for the field factory:

 hi i have been trying to put a facebook like butto on my android app so that the users will be able to like my facebook page on clicking it.    i think i have done everything as directed in the facebook developers page at  https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/like-button/     but on clicking the like button  the app shows a blank white page and then returns to the app again. here are the codes that i have been using     this is the part of the layout used by me:         the mainactivity.java is as follows. i will have to implement it in the fragment placed in the mainactivity.java         can anyone tell me what mistakes have i made??  
 i have a pretty simple mysql record like this:         and here is its hibernate entity; nothing fancy         for convenience  i use gson to parse the entity from json string which front-end passed in.   the json string for the record is like this:         then userentity will be parsed from the json string:         i can insert or update the user with   and  .    if every field is contained in the json string  then things seemed goes as expected. but when some field  such as   is omitted:         which indicated that i should make a partial update and leave the omitted field not modified  things went wrong. because  the parsing procedure will set   to null. and update it to the database.    so  is there a solution to partially update the record in this case?    going through every field and setting fields one by one will be the last option; anything other than that?    thanks in advance.  
 first post!    i am using   in  .    i am creating an array that holds n integers and filling the array with random integers.    i cannot seem to figure out how to do that though. all i can figure out is that it is supposed to be in the main method and that the size of the array and the minimum and maximum value of the random integers are defined by the constants.    my class  :         here is an example of the output i am looking to get:         i should note that i am aware that it doesn't exactly have a print function of any kind yet  but i want to get the random integer thing down first.

 i have seen many questions regarding object created using string literal and new keyword like:     how many string objects using new operator     but it doesn't clarify my doubts.     case 1: string object using string literal. it creates one object in string constant pool if it is not present otherwise  return the reference of this object.this object is implicitly interned.    case 2:string object using new(). it creates 2 objects one in string constant pool and another one in heap area.reference variable refer to the heap area object.for this object we need to call intern method to put this object into string constant pool explicitly.    my question is if new() already creates one object in string constant pool then  what is use of calling intern method on the object which is there in heap area?

 in my game  i have an inputhandler class that handles my action listeners. i have it working for other parts of my game code  but for some reason the key listener does not respond to my inventory class. in my inputhandler class (it extends jpanel):         in my inventorygui constructor:         the tick method in the inventory class (the key i is properly created in my inputhandler):         canchange is true. for some reason  the input does not seem to be working. the inventory screen is ticking  but no response from the key listener. any help would be greatly appreciated!    edit: since this class is a jpanel  i tried using keybindings  but that still didn't work. i added this to the constructor:         and pressedaction is created outside:

 i am having some troubles of copying an object to a new object.    initially i tried this:         but then i noticed that the changes i make in \"clonedstate\" affects \"state\" as well.    so then i went to search  and found out about deep cloning. some people suggested using libraries  others to serialize  then deserialize.    is there no way of doing this without any of these?    i also tried this  with the same results:         after further reading  i tried using serialization and de-serialization. so i added this method in my constructor class:         and in the main class  i added this:         somehow  the results are the same... i modify \"clonedstate\"  and \"state\" is being modified as well.    i greatly appreciate any help!    edit:    for reference  here is the method where it happens:         and here is the output:

 when programming in java on cloud9  how do you import a user class?    under my workspace \"java_projects\"  i have two directories(packages) \"~/workspace/project1\" and \"~/workspace/project2\"    there is a test1.java file in project1 that imports a class from project2:         but the compiler doesn't recognize the project2 package(\"package project2 does not exist\") and will not compile.    i've looked up and tried fixing the classpath to resolve this issue but with no luck. i feel like there is a fundamental reason for why this won't work but i have no idea. apologies in advance for being a noob ^^;; eclipse simplified all this packaging business but i guess i'll have to learn the details to use java on cloud9. any suggestions/references to learning more about this is greatly appreciated~

 i am in the early stages of developing an app that will have a single activity with 4 fragments navigated by swiping. currently all i'm trying to do is get the activity to load/display the first fragment splash. i have added the fragment to the activity in the main.xml as shown below.    main.xml         mainactivity.java         i'm getting an error:    cannot resolve method 'add(int  com.cdw.ddb.splash)'    on this line    .add(r.id.splashfrag  fragment)    from searching online it seems that the most common issues associated with this are not declaring \"extends fragmentactivity\" for the activity or using the incorrect import statement. i don't believe either of these is my issue. i would appreciate any guidance on the issue. thanks.

 i am implementing the  fragment view inside the viewpager .the situation is i have multiple tabs on click of which the fragments loads the data from web.  ow let suppose i have 5 tabs with all tabs assigned different forms for which the details filled after calling the web service.  ow  the problem is   on first fragment  the data loads using asynctask  and now when i swipe/click on tab for next fragment  the same async task loads again.     below is my code:     view_pager_client.xml           viewpagerfragment.java           fragmentpageradapter.java          now in profile summary and for contact list i am loading data from web. the task which executes for profile summary  also executes for contact list.     please help me in resolving the query.   
 so i was reading the book and the author says \" the static members aren't involved in runtime polymorphism. you can't override the static members in a derived class  but you can redefine them.\"    what is that mean? can you give me a example for this also?     thank you.   
 i'm implementing a restful web service where user has to send a signed verification token along with the request so that i could ensure that the request has not been tampered by a middle man. my current implementation is as follows.    verification token is a verifdata object serialized into a string and then hashed and encrypted.         in my service  i put data to be serialized into an instance of verifdata and then serialize it using jackson objectmapper and passed along to the verification engine along with the verification token.         but it seems that each time the application container is started  the order of properties being mapped into a string by objectmapper changes.    ex: one time it would be         and another time it would be         so if client has serialized the verifdata instance as into the first string  there is 50% chance of it being failed even though it is correct.    is there a way to get around this? can i specify the order of properties to map by objectmapper (like in ascending order)? or is there any other way to best implement this verification step. both client and server implementations are developed by me. i use java security api for signing and verifying.  
 i have a servlet. but instead of making that servlet listen to a static url (e.g:  )  i want it to listen to a dynamic url  or a url with regex (e.g:  ) which in this case will listen to a url  mysite.com/testservlet  followed by any numbers. how do i do that?  
 we are building a chat client (something like whatsapp  etc.) for sending and receiving private messages. for the sake of privacy we decided to encrypt and decrypt the messages upon arrival and sending.      i figured we could use rsa private and public keys for encryption. i understand that we usually need two pairs of keys  one of which residing on the server and one on the phone. this brings up some questions which i'm asking here.      how to generate a key pair in android?   how should they be stored?   do i need different key pairs for every user on the server as well as on the clients?      please feel free to add any useful information for i am a complete newbie in security.

 i am using sprint tool suit (sts). i have a java project created using maven say  project1 . i have few dependencies and a jar plugin to create the jar file. in all the classes and methods i have included the java doc. i did maven install on pom file and it generated the jar file in local maven repository.    i have another java project created using maven say  project2 . it's a multi module project. one module is dependent on  project1. . so i added the dependency in the pom file of that module. but i am not able to see the java doc. not only for that jar  all the maven dependencies  i added  i am able to see the class file without java doc.    i added the maven eclipse pugin in the parent pom file of  project2          but it's not working.    do i need to run the command in terminal as mentioned in  this so answer ? or do i have to add any plugin in my project1? without terminal commands is it not possible?  
 i wasn't expecting this behaviour and unsure whether it's a bug or by design.    we have a parent object with a list of child objects.  it's a uni-directional relationship using a join table.  if a client requests a parent object merge  hibernate  increments the version of the parent object even though none of its details have changed .  i wasn't expecting the parent object version to change as  logically  the parent object is exactly the same.  does anyone have an explanation?    note 1: it's due to the collection being marked as dirty in the flush  however this doesn't happen if the collection is empty or the parent object doesn't contain a collection    note 2: very similar to  https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/hhh-3007  which has been auto closed due to inactivity    note 3: using hibernate 4.3.7.final  but tested same behaviour in hibernate 3     test to reproduce           department.java           employee.java        
 i'm currently trying to fix a memory leak in my program and my brain starts to throw outofoptions exceptions. the program creates a lot of objects and i dereference them with   as soon as they aren't needed any more  but somehow the memory usage keeps still growing over time. now i'am asking myself if i have to dereference variables inside an object as well.    for example:         is it enough to do   or do i also have to dereference every variable separately in the pojo object?  
 so i learned about making tabs in android using fragmentactivity from  this tutorial . so now i have a fragmentactivity that holds 3 tabs  which means within those tabs are three different fragments.     fragmentactivity class          and i have two fragments that become the two tabs of the fragmentactivity:     one fragment:          so i have stored some information such as 'name' and 'description' in the sharedpreferences of the application.         i want to access those information through one of the fragments like this:         however i can't access the 'ctx' (context) through the fragment. is there a way to pass the context of the fragmentactivity to the fragment classes such that they can retrieve stored information from the sharedpreferences? or is there a better way to access common information through the fragments (tabs)?

 when i'm posting the text from a txt file to twitter i'm getting the following error in certain cases.         an uploadfile class is created with a file parameter  and post() is called on it.         the twitterposter class follows:         however  if i post the same string that's being posted through the uploadfile using a main test method within twitterposter. i get no error.         this error doesn't always occur with other strings. this is one case that i know is problematic. i'm not exactly sure where the error is coming from. i've read through the twitter4j javadocs and other resources  and couldn't find an answer.

 i am coding a game and have an abstract class known as  gameobject  and three classes extending it ( player  wall  and enemy ).     i have a list defined as so containing all the objects in my game.         when i need to do something with on of the objects  this is how i would do it:         so as you can see  i have to go through the whole list and check types to find just to find a single object. this seems to me like it's not very efficient. so i then thought about storing the different derived classes in their own lists.         would this be more efficient rather than going through the whole list containing everything and checking it's type to decide wether or not to do something? thanks so much.   
 i am working on opencms  a java-based cms. i have a list collection in which i am storing cmsresources which i get from a category like:         now  i have written some code to sort it like:         when i loop through the collection using iterator then the order is not correct. it should be ordered according to date  ascending or descending  as i am trying to do with the comparator.    i have iterated through using:         please can anybody help me.  
 i have a number of java classes that are already implemented. i would like to add some behavior to these classes; this behavior in some cases could be identical for all classes.  it is also assumed that i can not create a super class since all the classes are already implemented.    the question  i have is what options do i have in this regard.    interface: is it possible that for some interfaces i implement them once and have classes share the single implementation (since in some cases the implementation required would be identical for all classes). this would avoid manual duplication of code in all classes.    i thought about defining an abstract class and having the classes extend the abstract class; the problem is that the sublcasses would in this case would not be a meaningful extension of the abstract class since they do not form a meaningful hierarchy.    thanks.  
 suppose i have multiple methods that each return optional. i want to chain them together so that if one of them returns an optional with a value then the chain should stop propagation and should stop at that point. e.g. let's say that f1  f2  f3 each return optional.    if i do something like this          i see that even if f2 returns an optional.of(t)  f3 still gets called.    i want it to behave like a short circuiting expression but it does not work that way.    can anyone please help me with this.  
 so this is a snippet of a larger program. not shown in the below code is a jframe \"framer\" which i have properly set up and which also contains a jpanel with various jlabels. what i am aim for in the below code is a way for me to access the object \"face\" which is of type \"facer\" which extends jpanel  where \"facer\" is properly added to the jframe \"framer\" with all of this displaying properly. the below code shows some things that i have tried. regardless of where i use .getname() i always get null. \"line4\" gets me access to scrollpane rather than the object  which i also have added to the jframe. i also find it odd that getparent().getparent() gives a jlayeredpane (which i am not using) rather than a jframe.     all of this is basically a watered down version of the real area of code i'm stuck on but solving this would essentially show me what to do in the other scenario. basically  all i'm asking is how i can get getparent().getname() or getparent().getparent().getname() to print out the object's name (which in this case is \"facer\" or \"framer\") rather than null or its type information as shown in my outputs below.          the output gives me       
 im using the latest sonarqube to analyse a java project. in this project i have a simple range class with 2 long attributes - start and end. when looking at the coverage data for the class i see this:         basically it means i have 114 different tests passing through this constructor. i also have tests verifying each and every assert there (so a test with a negative start  another with negative end  a third with start before end etc).    and yet sonarqube thinks there are uncovered branches. what are the 4 branches in   ?

 i am encountering erroneous results while trying to encode and decode a string read from a file on disk.    i am using the following code to decode and then encode :         on the basis of this code  i was expecting that if i print \"word\" and \"tempstr\"  i should see the same result. however  the values are different.     for example  if word = \"hi!\"  then tempstr = \"hi//\" and all single letter words get converted to null values. for example  if word = \"a\"  then tempstr = \"\".    the file on disk is in   encoding.    it would be very helpful if someone can explain the cause of this error.     sorry if this is very basic question  i don't have much prior experience with encoding formats.    thanks  
 i want to know why i did not need to specify a url for a datasource object.     this is maybe the other way round since most questions here seem to be why something did not work  but in this case  it did work  but i don't understand why.    i wrote this code:         }    then i used the new class thus  expecting something to go wrong:         but it didn't go wrong. it worked first time.    before i started working on datasources  ie when i just used drivermanager  i could not establish a connection without the url of the database. i was expecting to go through a long learning curve finding out how to get the datasource to recognise the database  register it with jndi and all the stuff the tutorials tell you about eg  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/connecting.html     instead  it just found it.     i was working with netbeans 8.0.1 and i created the 'capitalism' database as an embedded jdbc database in it. for what it's worth  the properties dialog of this database says the url is jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/capitalism [alan on alan] and it was running when i executed the code. the only other relevant piece of information i can think of is that this was running in a vaadin project.    i suppose it's an unusual question to ask why something worked  but i would like to know because if i don't know why it worked  i can't reliably transfer it to a working context.

 in my java gui program  i have a button  of which upon clicking  will create a new thread that plays a song in the background.  had i not created a new thread  and just played it in the actionlistener  the song would freeze up the rest of the gui to be unusable until it finished.    however  i would like a means for the user to stop the song.. which in code i would take to mean 'terminate the thread'.  i've tried some online answers like the deprecated .stop() .interrupt() methods  but they don't seem to work.  i think this has something to do with the fact that the thread that plays the song is in thread.sleep() for the duration of the song..  any way to terminate a sleeping thread?  -thanks  
 i want to add customers to a database using jsps  jquery and servlets. when a customer already exists within the database table i want to show a confirmation message (customer already exists. are your sure you want to add the same customer?). when customer does not exist all the data is written into the table and there is no need to show a confirm message.     my jquery code so far:         and my servlet:         when i click the submit button it always shows the confirmation message.  i don't wanna show confirmation message when the customer does not already exist in the database.

 in a java swing desktop app. i have a number of smaller classes  all of which are  made use of in an overarching app class. one of such smaller classes is a jpanel that represents my login page. i've added a mouselistener to the login button on this page  that goes thus:         ...         in a separate display class that represents my jframe  i make the login page an attribute of said class and i instantiate this display class in my app class  after adding the login page to it. i am trying to capture the login page username attr in the app class and pass it to other methods. but when i run the code  and click on the login button  the value in the textbox isn't captured.    to error check  i tried the ff:         when i run the code  enter a name on the username textfield  and click login  the typed name and a true value for the capturedname boolean are both printed  but the          condition is never fulfilled. also when i add in print display.loginpage.username  i get a null value . what could be the reason for this discrepancy between the same values?

 i am attempting to use apache commons math 3.3 for a static data processing class  and am using eclipse mars to create it. i have successfully downloaded the bin and src files  and added them to the build path of my project; i can see them in my jre system library. i have also added the javadoc url in the 'javadoc location' tab. i am successful in importing classes from the library.    however  when i attempt to instantiate an object from ac-m  eclipse is unable to resolve that object as a type. for instance           the import statement works fine. however  immediately eclipse reads an error in my 4th line of code:    summarystatistics cannot be resolved to a type     this occurs for all other objects  e.g.       etc. (i successfully import the respective portions of the library for all objects.) eclipse offers an option to 'fix project setup..'  yet upon clicking  no solutions are available. i have cleaned the buildpath to no avail. i would appreciate assistance in fixing this problem.     edit: i added the jar files by selecting the package of interest and clicking properties>jre system library [jre8] edit...>installed jres...>edit...>add external jars...then adding commons-math3-3.3.jar to the library.   
 one of the ways to ensure following the structured programming paradigm is by having all control flows having only one entry and one exit point. does skipping iterations by using break and continue in languages like java count as a second exit point (like a goto-statement) or not?  
 i'm configuring spring security oauth 2.0 to secure a number of jersey exposed rest services. i'll be using an external identity server as the authorization server. it'll be responsible for issuing and storing access tokens to its own token store. so  token validation process should be done against this server through a validation web service.    how should i configure spring security to work only as a resource server?    all the examples i found uses spring security to create both authorization server and resource server (which have access to the token store). this is not possible in my case.    thanks.  
 i want to execute a   once another   finishes  regardless of whether or not the first one completes exceptionally (  only runs when execution completes normally).    for example:          this prints          and i would like it to be         preferably without nesting the second   inside the first.    note that i don't care about the returned result/exception here.

 i'm studying mandarin and want to change the language of my android smartphone (sony xperia) between english/mandarin (or english/mandarin/portuguese/spanish) faster than using the default system settings. the way it is  i have to enter settings  scroll to the middle of it (which is slower than if it was on the beginning or end of the list)  click language &amp; input  click language  have to scroll all the way down to ?? (it should already be at the top  among the \"recently used languages\"  but only my native language is always there)  click ?? and finally click ok.    i would like to reduce those 6+ clicks to a single button in the quick settings area (there is space for 4 more icons): when the phone is in a language  a tap on the icon would change to the next language  holding the icon would open a menu to add/remove languages/change order/etc.    i'm new to android development  so i don't know if it's possible for an app to change the system language (need root privileges? i want it for myself  even if i won't be allowed to share it on google play  for instance). i've seen many answers on how to change an app language  that's not what i'm looking for. i also found many apps in google play  all of them promising to \"quick toggle system language\" etc  but none of them worked on my device. the closest i got was  this   but looks like a dead thread.    so  is it possible? if so  where is the documentation?

 for   method  this method would only be invoked if an item is clicked  right? if an item is clicked in that activity  but for some weird reason the programmer did not have the if statement to check for that item's id  does return   enter into an infinite loop of keep calling this method?     my guess of   means calling the parent class and invoke this method again?

 i'm working on a linked list project  and i'm having a great trouble with the constructor.    i already implemented the default constructor (creates empty list. aka data = null  size = 0) but the other constructor is really confusing me !!!!    i want to implement a constructor that creates a linked list with values/elements in it (string[]). my first thought was \"piece of cake  all i have to do is :      use the default constructor to create an empty linked list   use a for-each loop within a for loop.  the for-each loop is to iterate the string array and add them to my empty linked list.  the for loop is needed to keep a track of the index.\"      here is my code:         i tested my code by using this constructor but it does not work. i know there is a silly mistake somewhere but my logic/mind is blind to see it.   
 i have been struggling for now one hour to perform a very basic thing. indeed  i have a class called   that holds a   :         i then have a class called   that is a javafx form constructed by taking a   as a parameter. it creates one field for each key of the map and set the associated value. i would like any change done in the textfields to change the relevant pair in the map accordingly. i know i could use   but i would like to keep by   class totally javafx-independent.    i can think about some wrapper class that would wrap my map and provide binding methods  but what i would prefer here is a simple change listener to define. however  after diving into the documentation i found nothing that worked :      i tried defining the   property but my listener was never fired   i tried setting the value using   in an   method  but the returned by   is not always synchronized with the value displayed in the field   i found the   class that would be perfect for me but is protected etc).      what is the best way to do what i want without needing to modify   ?  
 i am currently working on a dialog window for my android game using libgdx. this dialog window contains a collection of labels and buttons  but should also contain an image. the image represents the \"remaining health indicator\"  i.e. an empty indicator with a symbol indicating the health of the player. this indicator has to be filled with a colored rectangle representing the remaining amount of health (see screenshot below).         in order to render this on a dialog of libgdx  i have to draw an image and a colored rectangle (the red rectangle indicating the real amount of remaining health). i know that the dialog supports the rendering of images  but i don't know how to first draw the rectangle.     this is the code i have so far:             
 i am making a javafx application. this is how it looks in my retina and non-retina imac:         and this is how it looks in my retina windows 7 (bootcamp):         first of all  it looks smaller. next  everything is wrongly positioned.    what's up with this? i developed with java 8 and running on java 1.8 se.  
 can anyone tell me how to enable jsp checking for pmd?  i have an existing maven web project that i'm trying to get pmd syntax checking going for.   pretty typical configuration:         i'm using the maven plugin  version 3.3 (current)  which uses pmd 5.2.1.   theoretically  this includes checking for jsp files  but none of my jsp files are being touched.

 the oracle java specification pages that are online list the \" .in \" static variable in the system class as being of type inputstream.     however  the class inputstream is abstract. so  no instance of inputstream can exist.     therefore  the developers must have subclassed inputstream to create the \".in\" instance.     what is the exact type of the \".in\" variable?    thanks.  
 i understand that in spring framework  the default scope of the bean is singleton. it means that only one instance of the bean is created per the container.    but i am not able to understand practically below scenario.    for example class   let say class \"singletonclass\" is configured as singleton bean in spring context.xml   1) for every time there is a request for this class  does it use same instance. if yes then if i make a call like    from another class and     will give me the results correctly or there will be a problem some times?     2) if same instance is used by all the requests  how is it possible behind the scenes that using only one instance is used by all the requests? if there are 100 requests to the same singleton class   each request has to wait until previous request is finished?    edit:     let say i am using @autowired and not new operator    in my main class  i am trying to use bean configured using spring. let say if mymain is called multiple times(may or may not be concurrent calls)  i want to understand point 2 in my post above(edit)       
 i have a role node that contains some privileges that i am trying to persist into neo4j.  when i construct the object  i see that the privileges exist  but after the save call they disappear.    here's my role node:         here's my save:         before i save the object it is fully populate and after it's empty.  any ideas as to why that might be    edit: the code causing the issue is in my privilege class.    this does not work:         this works:         why would that be causing it to not persist?  what am i missing in my rolerepository?   
 i created an application to visualize audio playback. to do this  i made a subclass that draws a wave with the given stats of the music at a certain point in time. however  i am having trouble with the audio methods in java.    in cocoa  you work with    which i am relatively familiar with. unfortunately  i cannot find documentation on the correlating class(es) in java. i am trying to get the equivalent methods on   that are found on    and was wondering if any such methods exist  or if i will have to create them. below is the objective-c code that would achieve the desired effect.           does not appear to have methods to capture the average power for channels. is there a different class that provides the functionality of   with metering enabled?    can anyone point me in the right direction? i tried searching documentation and googling  but was unsuccessful.    the closest i've come so far is with the following method  but it seems like it just returns the volume of the clip.        
 i have been doing a coding exercise inside the intellij idea community edition 14 ide  using openjdk. i'm new to the linux environment so please bare with me!    the project is split over 4 .java files all in the same package. my end goal is to run this in the terminal/bash (i use system.console().readline() which doesnt play nicely in the ide's console).    i've tried navigating to the directory where these 4 files reside (they all reside in the same dir) and tried:         this creates 4 corresponding .class files fine. the main is in bibliotecaapp.java/class  so i try run it by:         but i get the error         plus about 13 lines of specifics.    now googling this error seems to be a class path problem  and this is where i get stuck. from places i've read  using  gives me:         this is still from the directory of the .java files above. that path means nothing to me. i have no idea what it is or what it does  or what even a classpath is! theres alot of resources out there on setting a classpath  but they arent helping me because i don't know what it's meant for.    that was a dead end for me. i tried to create a .jar instead using idea's   as seen  here . it created a .jar file but when i navigate to that directory and try run it via:         i get         another issue is that in the file explorer  the file actually comes out as biblioteca.jar  but ls on that dir shows biblioteca_jar. is that normal?    i'm not entirely sure where to go from here! the code is on my github if that helps anything  https://github.com/botagar/twu-biblioteca-johngeddes     any help would be greatly appreciated!  
 i've been drawing bezier curves in opengl es 2  referencing the following  hlsl  shader. below shows the result:          the shader referenced relies on if statements to accomplish the effect:          as these greatly degrade performance in the opengl pipeline  i thought that instead of using an if statement to coerce the alpha or discard the fragment  i could just force the edge pixels to become transparent if they were less than 0f  using the clamp function:         however  this does not work as the side pixels remain partially visible:          my question is  am i missing something fundamental about the   function? why should zero alpha quantities be visible at all?  
 i am a newbie in developing rcp application. i am trying to execute application which is built with plug-in in rcp. when i try to run the application it gives me following null pointer exception. i am not able to understand where my code is breaking or where to look to resolve this exception. can someone please help? the application is not able to execute with java 1.7 or 1.8. thank you in advance.

 to begin  i am developing an app with android studio which uses a backend created using endpoints with objectify. i have an existing entity containing several fields  one of which is a collection. in working on this app i have successfully deployed to localhost and appspot and have been crud ing away without any issue.. until now. all of my previous @index and @unindex fields can be seen in the datastore viewer in the developer console. but when i create a new list field it is no where to be found. i can successfully add and remove all other data types except for collections.    here is a snippet:         ...getters and setters    now when i add         and deploy nothing happens and i die a little inside.    in going through what i can see from the generated client library  everything appears to match up with the previous \"friends\" collection.     a quick thought. the development of this app has been slow and i have gone through a couple versions of objectify and am currently on v5.1.3. perhaps when the first collection field was created objectify handled collections differently. the release notes mention issues with the @embed annotation in converting from v4 to v5 but nothing about what i am experiencing.    another weird note here. when i annotate the \"newfriends\" collection with @serialize and deploy.. voila we have lift off. once this new @serialize collection is recognized in the entity i can then go back and change the annotation to @unindex and all is fine. so really i have solved what i wanted to solve  it just seems that there is a bug crawling around objectify v5. or perhaps i am missing something obvious which is why i am inquiring upon the ever so wise community of so. thanks in advance.   
 i get this error whenever i do anything even this simple with java_opts in tomcat's setenv.sh              causes that error. ideas?  
 i cannot figure out why calling getbytes() twice on a string returns two byte arrays that are not equal():         prints:         e.g. the following assertion always fails:         from the  doc   i wasn't expecting any nondeterminism! what am i missing?    when converting back to string  the result is the expected one  so my best guess is some uninitialized padding bit?    i.e. the following assertion always passes:       
 so i have a socket situation where i have a multithread server that receive x number of connections and manage all of them (i use this code to base mine:  http://www.java2s.com/code/java/network-protocol/amultithreadedsocketserver.htm ). that's not completely my code but i used that as a base for the multithreading:         the problem is that all those clients connected to me are waiting a response from the user which provide that response using keyboard input (bufferedreader system_in = new bufferedreader(new inputstreamreader(system.in)); )  but i need to list all the threads that i have opened and select manually the one that i want to interact with. how can i do that??    so for example to the first socket i want to send   and   to the second.

 let's say i have 100 entities in my datastore.    i have sorted my query on basis of a property say \"age\" using          i have a variable startpoint from another function which tells me the start point of the result needed.    now that i need to query 10 entities (startpoint to startpoint+10) from the sorted query.    example: if startpoint = 51  i need result entity to have values of 51-61 rows of the sorted query.    how can i implement this in java?    please do comment if any further information is necessary.

 i have a class like this:         the tempval will be an integer. it compiles and runs fine. but if i change the  t extends comparable  to     above if statement generated the following compile error:         i can cast the  new integer(0)  to  t  to remove the compile error. my question is should i use   or  ?     i guess the   should be the way to go but that   cast seems annoyance. is there anything wrong in my code?  
 i am trying to see if there are spaces after a certain char  if there aren't i will count++ if there are then it won't  i have no idea how to do this! i am doing it in an if statement  and i know how to check for the letter but not if there are spaces afterwards. i tried this but it doesn't seem to work!        
 i know how to implement the comparable interface... i have just one question.         in the   method  are you supposed to handle the case where obj is not an instance of realnumber? should you throw an exception in this case?    or should you just assume the class invoking your compareto method only does it for other   instances?

 i am getting the exception org.hibernate.persistentobjectexception: detached entity passed to persist. from the numerous posts on this forum and elsewhere  i understand that this happens in two cases(not considering one-one annotations etc)        there is an issue with the transaction going out of scope    an id is set where it should be automatically generated.       i see neither of these happening with my code. i am unable to reproduce the error  because i don't have the data which initially triggered it. on other data it runs perfectly fine. i have provided an scce below:         myimportejb.java:         myclass.java         persistence.xml         the exception is thrown on calling entitymanager.persist(mappedobject) &lt;- myimportejb.saveobject &lt;-myimportejb.saveobjects. i dont have the line number    i have tried writing a sample program where i get an existingfoo object from the database  update and save it  because that was the most likely source of the error. but i could not reproduce the error. please help.    edit: here are the details of getlistofx() as requested     from myprocessor.java:         from the file myimportejb.java:         edit: also added the details of getfoosforwidanddates(). it was suggested to me that i set the id on a new foo to null before adding it to the save queue. i would like to know if it is possible that the id is being set \"under the hood\" by hibernate to an unacceptable value  
 relatively simple question. i need to translate/localize a legacy java application.    our company  with newer applications uses   files in java for localizing their strings  and this concept is very similar to   files in c# (which we also have products using that).    the problem is this is a legacy product that was around before we started thinking about localization. it is full of hard coded strings and also various forms of hard-coded string concatenation/formatting.    as far as i am aware i have a very daunting task of pulling all our strings and formatting into   files in the product and then referencing those in the code.    personally i have no huge issue doing this work  but i want to make sure i am not missing something.    so i have a couple general questions.       is there a faster way of converting my product to use the   files? off the top of my head i could write a script that would automate maybe 30-40% of the work...     are there any \"gotchas\" i should be worried about specific to converting a legacy product (i am not looking for general localization \"gotchas\" which i can google for  but anything specific to this scenario)?     finally  are there any completely different strategies i am overlooking for localization? this is just how we translate our existing products  but because this is a legacy product (and on the agenda to be re-written) this is essentially throw-away code and i could do pretty much whatever i want. including just finding the cheapest dirtiest fastest way possible  although i am obviously leaning toward doing the job properly.      any thoughts  people?    as a guideline i would say try to keep answers focused on the questions being asked  but any informational contributions or questions are always welcome in comments.  
 i have a java   and i can't change it to a   although i could copy it over.  here is the issue:    i have names   tower  car  building   office   basement.   i have a pojo which has a string label variable containing one of these for each instance.    how can i sort these to be the exact order of  tower  car  building   office   basement.  there will be no duplicates allowed of course(its a set).           so imagine i have 10 places objects with labels that could be any of  tower  car  building   office   basement: how can i sort these in a set to ensure that they are in the exact order of  \"tower  car  building   office   basement\" ?

 i have run into what i think is a problem with enums and the xmlencoder.    the enums are only being correctly encoded once so my output is like:         notice the second card  the cardvalue property is not fully expanding enum. i would expect it to be:         are my expectations wrong? is this the way enums are supposed to behave? i have seen some stuff on how singletons need special encoding  is that the case with enums?    the code to reproduce this is as follows. i have a base card class with a couple of enums:         and a deck class:       
 i'm trying to get the user variables from facebook after the user logs in on this android application.  i can't figure out why   is not being called.    eclipse is giving me the warning: the method oncompleted(graphuser  response) from the type new request.graphusercallback() is never used locally    i looked up similar issues but the issue was that they were missing executeasync(); i've got it here. i'm wondering if it has something to do with implementing onclicklistener or conflicting with my volley class?    here is the code

 i'm having the issue when my cache keys are colliding in spring using the   annotation. for instance  with the following two methods:         here is my cache configuration  in which i've added a   and a   bean:         for some reason  the cache key always gets set to the   parameter in the method  not the result of the   method  causing both methods to return the same cache result.    i know that i can specify the key manually on each   annotation  but that seems a little extensive for every method i'd like to cache.    edit    i've noticed that setting the   option inside of the   annotation to the name of my bean resolves the issue  like so:         and setting the   option in the   annotation on the class also resolves the issue. it seems that this shouldn't be necessary though. am i missing something?

 i am creating a program that reads four letter words from a .txt file. the player  when they say \"yes\" to play the game  the computer will randomly select an integer and then go and pick out the word at that line in the .txt file. then the player will be given 7 tries to guess the word. what i am having trouble with is being able to call the methods in my randomwordprovider class that will return the random integer and then the corresponding word. here is what i have done:         now right here at the bottom i created the instances and i am now trying to call my randominteger and getword methods to my main method but i do not know how to do that. i keep getting confused on the arguments i need to include with the getword method. if someone can show me what to do  that will be greatly appreciated!

 i'm using reactor 2.0.0.m1  and i'm trying to filter a  . depending on the results of my boolean operation  i want to either continue with one or another stream. this seems to be possible with the   function  but its not exactly clear how to use it.    my stream looks something like this:         to handle the case where   is true  my understanding is i can just call   to continue down the stream.    to handle the case where   is false  i can access the alternate   stream.    but there doesn't seem to be an   or similar method  so it doesn't seem possible to configure both streams in a completely fluid way.    the best i can come up with is something like this:         is that really the best way to proceed?  
 right now my server only can handle one client at a time. i am trying to use a thread so that the server can handle several clients  but i am doing it wrong. i have added the thread in the try/catch clause where the serversocket accepts the client  but this makes no difference. i don't get an error or anything  but it just doesn't work. so what i want to do  is make the server not freeze at one client  but still accept several clients.    here is the server code:         here is the client code:       
 i have made a netbeans application that is reliant on the db network server in order to retrieve data. in netbeans the code works fine and runs well. outside of netbeans everything but the database information is working. i have made a batch file for connecting to the localhost server that seems to connect on the port i assigned: 1527. even after connecting to the localhost  it won't display the database information. my code in the batch file:         when i run this i get the result:         is there more code that i need to add in order to connect to the actual database itself from the server? or is this not the right way to do this at all? i have tried using the embedded db but that didn't work and only caused more problems. i would prefer greatly to stay away from it and stick to the network db.

 i did a script to execute every 10 minutes and when the files open on my java app is greater than 10000 it will execute a jmap command to give to me a heapdump.    my intention is to discover which class of my app is not closing the files or where there is a memory leak or why i receive the message \"too many files open\" after 20 hours executing it.    this is my script. does anybody have other ways or tools to discover where my app is not closing the files? thanks a lot!

 i am using processing's android mode to create a sketch. for now  i only want to display an ellipse using a custom dot class. eclipse is not detecting any errors. i will post the entire code for reference. the main activity's code is the following:         the dot class is the following:         when i try to run the app  the app crashes instantly and the message box 'unfortunately  yo has stopped'. i have to admit that i cannot point you more precisely to my problem  since i have no clue as to what is wrong in the code. the dot class is structured equivalently to the example given on the processing help page:  https://www.processing.org/reference/class.html  both classes are within the same package.    i have tried to instantiate the dot within the setup function  outside of it  or even continuously in the draw loop  with no success.    please let me know if you need more info. thank you in advance.  
 i've just recently picked up java and i'm aiming to make a simple graphical game with it so feel free to point out any style mistakes.     in transition from my main title screen to the main screen  my old title screen is not refreshed  the button used to click to get to the main screen is frozen  basically  the image is frozen and the main screen paintcomponent is not called and the program just goes into an infinite loop and will not close (have to shut down via task manager).    interesting thing to note is that  without the while loop it works just fine  the paintcomponent is called and everything works as it should  when reintroducing the while loop  same problem persists.

 in  udacity developing scalable apps with java course   some api methods of the backend application (that conceptually should be  httpmethod.get ) are implemented using  httpmethod.post .    the following comment is found at the java documentation:         does it mean that  even through a https connection  the json form would be sent in plaintext (i.e. not encrypted) if we use  httpmethod.get ?

 hi so this is my first time making an android app and i am trying to use sherlock themes. when i imported everything per the instructions from sherlock and after watching videos for importing sherlock into the android studio build.gradle. i am finding an error that i am unable to fix. i will link the  error below.    error:          android studio claims error is here app:showasaction=\"never\":         i also have an cannot resolve symbol \"r\" which i am unable to deal with as well in my mainactivity.java.         }    please help me make the first hurdle in my noviceness for programming android apps in android studio. thank you!  
 i have a java program which is basically a game. it has a class named   'world' . the \"world\" class has a method  'levelchanger()'   and another method  'makecolorarray()' .          the makecolorarray() method  makes a 2d array of type 'color' . this array stores color-objects from a png image. this array is used by the paint() method of the jpanel to paint the world on the screen.     the levelchanger() method is used to change the levels (stages) of the game when certain codition is true. it is the method which  calls the makecolorarray()  method to re-make the color-array while changing game-level.    the problem is that i have a game-loop which runs on a thread. now  the painting of swing components like jpanel is done on a different background thread by java. when the game-level is being changed  the color-array object is re-made. now  like i previously said  the color-array object is used by the paint() method to paint the world on the screen. sometimes  the color-array object is still being used by the background thread (not finished painting) when  according to game logic  color-array object is re-made and its members set to null. this is causing a  null-pointer exception   only sometimes. clearly a race condition.    i want to know how can i stop my game thread from resetting the color-array until the background swing thread has finished painting.

 i have a homework assignment that asks of me to check  for any three numbers  a b c such that 0&lt;=a b c&lt;=10^16  if i can reach c by adding a and b to each other. the trick is  with every addition  their value changes  so if we add a to b  we would then have the numbers a and a+b  instead of a and b. because of this  i realized it's not a simple linear equation.    in order for this to be possible  the target number c  must be able to be represented in the form:    c = x a + y b    through some testing  i figured out that the values of x and y  can't be equal  nor can both of them be even  in order for me to be able to reach the number c. keeping this in mind  along with some special cases involving a b or c to be equal to zero.    any ideas?    edit: it's not euclid's algorithm  it's not a diophantine equation  maybe i have mislead you with the statement that c = x a + y c. even though they should satisfy this statement  it's not enough for the assignment at hand.    take a=2  b=3  c=10 for example. in order to reach c  you would need to add a to b or b to a in the first step  and then in the second step you'd get either : a = 2  b = 5 or a = 5  b = 3  and if you keep doing this  you will never reach c. euclid's algorithm will provide the output yes  but it's clear that you can't reach 10  by adding 2 and 3 to one another.

 i am currently working on a project that will add a game to a database and then show that game and its information in a textview.  i have 2 spinners  one for the first letter of the game  and one for the name of the system.  i use the button sort to assign the spinners to a string as shown here          and the gamedata.select() function is called which is here         the two spinners have an all choice i.e display all games in a system or all games with a specific letter in all systems.  i cannot get a query to work that will return  say all for letters is selected and n64 is selected for system  it displays all games in n64. the cursor returns nothing.     i have tried          but nothing worked.  any advice?    edit:    everything is now working using          except for the          part of this.  it should display all games from all systems and letters but returns nothing.

 i am trying to post some data to my webservice but when i am testing it out in my device i am not getting error but at the same time nothing really happens  the tablet is responding just fine everything works but my webservice is not getting any data nor does the application show any error.    i have added some toast messages to check the flow of logic and from what i can determine the app goes into the method to send data to the webservice and then just does nothing.    this is my code         during testing the app executes this line   and shows         creating new user      message and  then nothing happens. my phone network is a bit faulty so may it be that it is taking a awfully long time to connect to my webservice or is my code faulty?     update      i tried a bit more debugging and found out that the code flow dies on the line         any one has any idea why?  
 i use a listview of an object. this object contains different attributes and an image. i get this image by asking the server a jpg image with an http request. i convert this image into a bitmap and i then display it.    my application is lagging and slow since i have added the bitmaps. is there any solution to reduce this lag?  
 in my current spring project  i am adding several pairs of classes (controller/service) to provide payment option through several payment services. each one of this classes have a structure like that:     controller           service          in the method   from service class  i need redirect the application to an url stored in a string variable (  in the example above).    my initial idea is use the library   from java and create a utilitary class like that:         anyone can give me a hint about how to accomplish that?  
 i usually run runtime#availableprocessors to determine how many cores on a windows computer and it works fine. the result is consistent with that i found from control panel.    however when i applied the api on a linux server  it returns 1. as i know the server is more powerful it doesn't make sense to me it's a single cpu system.     i did some search and found the linux box is  \"intel(r) xeon(r) cpu x5675  @ 3.07ghz\"  googling shows it has 6 cpu cores.    then the question is  why runtime#availableprocessors misreported? is it a bug?    thanks  john    here is the entire output of /proc/cpuinfo        processor       : 0      vendor_id       : genuineintel    cpu family      : 6    model           : 44    model name      : intel(r) xeon(r) cpu           x5675  @ 3.07ghz    stepping        : 2    cpu mhz         : 3059.000    cache size      : 12288 kb    fpu             : yes    fpu_exception   : yes    cpuid level     : 11    wp              : yes    flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss syscall nx rdtscp lm constant_tsc up ida nonstop_tsc arat pni ssse3 cx16 sse4_1 sse4_2 popcnt lahf_lm    bogomips        : 6118.00    clflush size    : 64    cache_alignment : 64    address sizes   : 40 bits physical  48 bits virtual    power management: [8]

 i am looking for the best way to clean up a background thread in android. i create the thread the following way:         it seems like calling looper.quitsafely() is the way to clean everything up for gc in versions of android 18+  but i have not been able to find a good solution for older versions of android. before android 18 the only option is the looper.quit() method which is \"unsafe\" according to the docs.  http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/looper.html#quit()   http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/handler.html#removecallbacksandmessages(java.lang.object)     my latest attempt at a solution to this problem is:         but i have been getting warnings when running tests:         i think that it is possible that there are problems with my tests because i am testing a lot of things that are running on background threads (async.) i am using countdownlatch to wait for the async code to finish running (callback) before ending tests  but i could be missing something.      this makes me question the following code:         is there a problem with this way of cleaning up a background thread/handler/looper or a better way to deal with this problem?   
 i am having my program read a .txt file and i don't want to use the absolute file name because it is machine dependent and i just want to use the relative file name. i don't know how to get it to do that. here is the part of my program i am talking about:         if i were to make it just:         then my catch exception comes in and says file not found. but i really just want to use...       
 how can i debug or run a class that extends  ? i am able to run the applet from the command line with appletviewer.          here is what class looks like:         here is what the html file looks like         how do i have to organize those files within my project and what settings do i have to use to debug the applet in netbeans? the thread  running a java applet from netbeans?  did not help unfortunately. i did what was suggested  but get a message telling me that the main class was not found. what i took from it though was that in my case the html file is not even needed? but just because i am curious is it still possible or recommended to use it?  
 i am using apache httpclient 4.3 to interact with the api of hubic.com. my minimal reproducable example is just a one liner:         however that throws:         here is the output if i run with  :         no exception is thrown if i try to access e.g.  https://google.com . so it guess ssl with java cannot be completely broken on my system but it has to do with the combination with hubic.com.    the error   is not very helpful  but in  this question  it is suggested that my client uses another protocol version than the server (i guess \"server and client could not agree on a protocol\" would be more accurate).    how do i figure out which protocol versions the server will agree on and how do i enable those in my client? and should i worry about the issue (e.g. like does hubic only allow an old unsupported protocol? (firefox certainly does not complain about anything unsecure).  
 i am trying to fill array with random numbers which will create a coordinates for another array.    this is my code for creating the initial array:         its creating a 2*3 array which has coordinates. the result is something like this:         2 3 is first coordinate than 3 0 than 0 1    this is okay if its large board  but if im trying to create a 2*2 board  it does duplicates coordinates. because the probability of the numbers. so for small board it will create something like this:         i tried to make single coordinate without duplicates. but i miss something and i cannot make this works. it would be great if i could get some help with this. thanks.  
 i am using google custom api example from   here  . my development environment is:-      eclipse 3.4   java 1.7   jsf 1.2 / rich faces 3.3   apache tomcat 7.0.55      i have added all the requisite jars (i assume this as i am not getting any compile time error in eclipse). the snap shot is:-     following imports are compiled with out error:-         when i run application  i get following error:-         what am i missing here. why a file that is available at compile time misses out at run time?   
 first of all  let me tell you that this is my first attempt to write some code with java so  if my question is a bit silly sorry about that.    in windows i've used eclipse as an ide and my project just compiles and run fine if i click the run button of eclipse. however when i've tried to compile and run my program through command prompt i got lots of errors. these are mainly :         i got all of these except the first one multiple times but for the clearity  i've copied them only one time.    now  i want to show my project directory          now  first i have typed   and then type   and as a result i've got the errors that i mentioned above. now does anyone who knows what is my problem ?

  got this question during an interview. wanted to know if there was a better solution:     given n tasks  and the dependencies among them  please provide an execution sequence  which make sure jobs are executed without violating the dependency.     sample file:         5        1&lt;4        3&lt;2        4&lt;5              first line is the number of total tasks. 1&lt;4 means task 1 has to be executed before task 4.    one possible sequence would be: 1 4 5 3 2     my solution uses a dag to store all the numbers  followed by a topological sort. is there a less heavy-handed way of solving this problem?:        
 i am using ecllipselink 2.5 in my project. default value for @transactionattribute  is required. if we define sessionbean as transactionmanagementtype container  do we still need to add @transactionattribute annotation for every method in sessionbean to support transactions? is there anyway to add default configuration for all sessionbeans or whole class? i don't want to add @transactionattribute with every method in class.    any help would be much appreciated.    thanks  
 in jdk 8  i can use reflection to call a method with a functionalinterface parameter  passing a lambda expression. for instance  this works.         however  if the parameter type is only known at runtime  how can i pass a lambda expression to the method? in other words  if i don't know at compile time the argument type of the method  but only know that it is a functional interface  can i use reflection to call it with a lambda expression?  
 i'm trying to make a list from a primitive array         but the last function   gives me an error because it wants other arguments. it wants 3 arguments supplier  objintconsumer and biconsumer.    i don't understand why it wants 3 arguments when i have seen different examples that just use   and get the list.    what i'm doing wrong?  
 i'm setting up a listview with an onclicklistener for each item.  this is being setup in an asynctask  in the onpostexecute() function;  each item in the listview should launch an activity that views data set up in the intent.  the data comes from an arraylist of arbitrary length.  all items in the listview launch only the last item from the arraylist.         listviewadapter is pretty straight forward.  it's an extension of a baseadapter.    i had this working when it was buttons in a linear layout  and it was an ontouchlistener.  don't know what i changed to break it  but working on it for 3 hours now.  any suggestions?  thanks in advance.

 i am trying to deploy this application (  http://briansjavablog.blogspot.com/2012/09/spring-jms-tutorial-with-activemq.html  ) onto tomcat  and i keep getting the error     caused by: javax.naming.namenotfoundexception: name [jms/mqconnectionfactory] is not bound in this context. unable to find [jms].     i understand that the error is generated because the spring beans can not find the resource jms/mqconenctionfactory. however  i can not figure out how to solve this error.         also my process to deploy this application:      go to the server tab on eclipse.   double click tomcat v7.0 server   go to modules and add external module   i pointed to inside the target folder  specifically the spring-activemq-sample-1.0 folder.      i did the external web module method because adding the normal web module wouldn't even deploy the application.  
 we have an mssql db set-up with column names of \"column 0\" and \"column 1\": note the space.    if i run the following command  it errors:    sqoop import --driver net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc.driver --connect jdbc:jtds:sqlserver://somemssqldb.com/ourdb --table dbo.ourtablename --username username --password ourpassword --columns \"column 0\" --target-dir s3://our-s3-bucket/9/data/1262/141893327230246 -m 1    stack trace reports:    error: java.io.ioexception: sqlexception in nextkeyvalue caused by: java.sql.sqlexception: incorrect syntax near '0'.    if we remove the column name spaces in the db as well as in the command  it works.    how can we get it to support using spaces in the --columns argument?  the only way we are successfully able to do so if by using --query specifically and escape.    for example we have to write a query like this:    select t.[column 1]

 my code is to change edittext to bold or italic .  this code to write a text in edittext and send it to another layout when touch in image1  this has intent to take text and size of text  i want another intent to take the bold or italic also .          also i have .xml file which has all the content i want ..  something like this        
 i get a very large string that contains n number of records. each record consists of 3 groups of text  the first 3 of which are encased in angle brackets. each group of text is 1-n characters in length. this overall pattern repeats 1-n times within the string. (see example below).         using the above as the input string  i'm trying to develop a pattern matcher that would return to me each individual record in the string. i've tried many variations but either get nothing  only the first record  or the whole string. i've read many posts regarding repeating patterns and have tried to apply the principles with little success. i been successful at finding ip addresses  phone numbers  and other patterns that might repeat within a given string  but this pattern eludes me. thanks in advance.  
 i have an existing web application and need to add a web service client to the application. for this i used jaxws framework and generated the artifacts using wsimport tool.    i added the generated artifacts to the package hierarchy in the existing web application and modified the package names in the generated artifacts.    now when i deploy the web app  the request is sent to the server  however no response is generated by the client. i debugged at network level and found that the response is sent by the server by it is not processed by the client. also its noticed that the build did not package the package-info.java files generated by wsimport. jaxws is new for me  so any pointers are highly appreciated.    thanks!

 edit: i want this window to be able to create multiple user profiles  so it needs to create more variables than just u1. the idea of the program is to mimic a social network. i don't know how to do this  however. thanks!    i'm new to java gui. so far  i have created a window with four text fields inside: first name  last name  gender  and hometown. i want to now create a button that takes the strings entered in those 4 text fields  and creates an object from them using this constructor:         here is my createprofile class so far. the relevant code for the button is at the bottom  and i'm pretty sure it's wrong / inefficient.

 i am writing a game using libgdx and i need to detect when the user touches a sprite. i tried to do so with this following code:    this code set the rect's position         and this code set the click as rectangle and checks if it overlaps the sprite         from some reason that i cant understand the program detects a collision even when it is not happened  when i tap anywhere on the screen it says that i pressed the sprite.    what should i do to fix it?

 i am implementing an applet which needs to access to file system and i need to show to user mock/fake files under mypc or userhome.     there is a way to do it using jfilechooser with filesystemview: this is a short example for windows os:         but the issue is that jfilechooser does not work properly on mac os. there is no ability to navigate into any subdirectory  move up from the current directory. here is a similar problem:  jfilechooser for directories on the mac: how to make it not suck?  (i switched off   mode  but it did not help)    now i am trying to use    but there is another problem:  i can not find a way to show mock/fake files under mypc or userhome (like filesystemview).    the question is: is there an ability to fix jfilechooser in mac os? or add mock/fake files into specific directory using filedialog?

 ok  so i am currently trying to select the most recent file in a directory (/fstp/logs in this example)  but i want to ignore any files that contain the string \"debug - null\"  but not the string \"debug - ma\" or \"info - ma\".  those search terms are instantiated through stechnull  stechvalid  and stechvalidinfo  respectively.      i want to skip over files that i consider null by my parameters (must have the 'ma' aspect in the file  to report accurately)  and go to the next file that does contain the data i'm looking for here in scanner.      i have tried a do-while loop  but i don't seem to have it correct.  i am also unsure if i should check for these strings and decrement the file lastmodifiedfile to get to the file i need containing non-null data.    i am aware my code below is incorrect.  i am just missing what i'm doing wrong.  to clarify  when this method fires  it will set the most recent  non-null file to be read by a scanner in another method.  if the lastmodified() method returns a file that contains data i do not want  i want to skip that file  and select the next file to be read for non-null data  and so forth.  once the code reaches an acceptable file to pass to the separate method  it will stop and not run until the next call of the recentlog() method.    hope i made this clear!    how should i be skipping the files i consider null?               edit: i found my solution  and most of you were correct  i was not clear enough.  i tried to implement @flup's solution using the comparator and a separate validation method.  i found this cumbersome for what i was trying to accomplish  due to further research into the log files i was going to be reading.  there were some files that contained all the strings i was looking for above  so i decided it was best to just filter the logging method i created in my package to write to an xml file.      i want to apologize for being unclear  but seeing my solution take form helped me understand how to better word my questions  as well as how to decide which set up would produce the behavior i'm looking for.  i ended up deciding to read the most recent file  regardless of content  and just checking in my logging script if the data is valid according to conditions set below:         the above method selects the most recent file.         the above snipped i have inserted into my first scanner method that i was going to pass my \"valid\" file into  but i felt that using a scanner twice was a bit redundant  so i instead used a filter by looking for when my log file did not contain any \"debug - ma\" or \"info - ma\" strings but did include \"debug - null\"  and assigned my desired values to null.         i then set my xml logging method to ignore the code and simply not execute the xml logging code if the foundtech variable was null.  this provided the behavior i wanted  as i did not want to update the .xml file if there was no new valid data.  what i was describing would have read backwards in my file list until it found valid data  and reported it each time.  i find that method would have been more difficult to maintain than a simple conditional statement in the logging method.  my file .lastmodified() method was already working fine for me as i had it  so i decided to attempt to filter out the bad files ahead of time.  thinking my solution through made me realize i did want to read the most recent file and pass that variable to my runlogger() method  so i will close this question.    sorry for the confusion of this all  i'm just a newbie navigating the waters for the first time.  on the upside  i just completed my first java/android project at work  and i'm moving into the testing phase now that everything is functioning properly!  thanks for the guidance stacko!  
 i cant seem to make jbuttons work with 2 jtextfield  my goal is:       1.if app starts and no jtextfield is focused(selected) by user : if user presses jbutton append to jtextfield tf[0].    2.if jtextfield tf[0] is focused(selected) &amp; user presses jbutton b[0] than append number to tf[0].    3.if jtextfield tf[1] is focused(selected) &amp; user presses jbutton b[0] than append number to tf[1].       here is my code  i tried using only actionlistener &amp; than added the mouselistener than changed it to mouseadapter but most of the time  either goal 2 or goal 3 is achieved not both or all 3 goals at same time.         this is a simple calculator app  i am trying to make. after a day of searching i couldn't find the solution anywhere in stackoverflow or google.

 if you are running multiple threads all with the same priority  why do you not need to call the yield or sleep method in any of the threads? i must have misunderstood how threading works. i was under the assumption that if two threads are of the same priority  one will finish before the other is started on a single core system. that is  unless you call one of the control functions ie.) yield() sleep() join() ... ect    anyone with the knowledge of this subject i would appreciate any clarifications you may have for me.    stackoverflow would not let me add a comment to your answer:    also according to my book: \"the jvm always picks the currently runnable thread with the highest priority. a lower priority thread can run only when no higher-priority threads are running.\"   
 hello i am new to android and ran into a strange error. i had this error handling script that i would need to be using through out the project. the code is currently working fine from the signup.java file. the code looks like this         i thought since i will be making frequent use of this block i should put it inside a seperate java class and then call it in all other classes i need this functionality so i created a   file and when i copy pasted this code and imported the   i still get the error that         cannot resolve method getbasecontext()      why this error  when the same code works fine in the other .java class?  
 i have a strange \"communication problem\" vaadin error when i try to do the following:    i have two uis  the first has a link which points to another ui  here's the code:         this ui results into this:      when i click on the link  a ne ui is initialized  here is the code of the new ui:         this results into:         here i type some text  and then when i click on the \"send data\" button  i get the following:         why do i get this communication problem? if the ui is not created from the clicked link  i.e. for example if i had put the shortcutui init() content inside the menuui  like in the following class:         the code would result into this:         all working as it should. no communication problem at all (\"some text\" and \"some other text\" are labels added when the click is performed on the \"send data\" button).    so why if i have a ui created from a link  a click event fired on a button causes this \"communication problem\" in vaadin?    this is the complete error as from ?debug vaadin console:         does anyone have any ideas why this happens?     thank you for the attention!  
 so i am having trouble finding/doing a property i set in my property file that values can be inserted into based on a position.    for example i would have this im my property file.    test.transfer=transfer {0} {1} - {2}    in these position i would insert my corresponding value and then that whole string would be used for my final value.    final value:  transfer from me - 123123132    i know i could write some java code but i believe java or spring already have these cover i just cant figure out what its called or how this is done.    any help or ideas is welcome.  
 i'm wondering if it's possible to use ado errors in java.    i'm looking at some asp code that uses ado for errors  i believe i've converted it to java.     is it possible to even do or is there better error handling in java?    i'm familiar with using a try catch block  but i'm not sure how to incorporate all the errors into one.    there are about 10 different errors  i cut them out for this question and just left a few errors for this question     snippet of asp code:           snippet of java that i'm trying to convert:

 i have a simple class with a private constructor and a static factory.  i want the class to serialize as a number  so i've annotated the getter for the field with  .  however  jackson appears to prefer the private constructor over the static factory  even when i annotate the static factory with  .  it works if i annotate the private constructor with    but that feels a bit off.    i've seen some posts claiming that   only works if the parameters are annotated with  ; however  that seems to be the case for objects serialized as json objects.  this object is being serialized as a number  and thus there is no property to supply to the annotation.    is there something i'm missing?     example class :          example tests:        
   doesn't seem to handle single digit day of the month:         in this example    correctly parses the date  but   throws an exception.  if i were to use zero padded dates  e.g.  \"05/03/1969\"  both work.  however  if either the day of month or the month of year are single digit  then   throws an exception.    what is the right   format to parse both one and two digit day of month and month of year?  
 i'm using apache tomcat for my study project and i want to convert a javascript array into a java array. is that possible? i saw some questions before but that didn't really answer my question.     if there's a way to do that  would you like to give a little explanation?   
 i would like to use spring security in a spring mvc application that consists of two modules -- a \"frontend\" and a management module. both modules have their own dispatcher servlet (with different mappings) so they do have their own web context  but share the same root context.    the management module has its own authentication database and users should be able to log into the \"frontend\" and management module simultaneously with different credentials. therefore i implemented two different  s.    i need two different  s where both are responsible for different urls  corresponding to the servlets mappings.    how can i configure such a setup? is it possible using java config?    edit: until now i have the following configuration  which allows me to authorize users for the management module. the \"frontend\" modules authentication / authorization using the autowired   is still missing.       
 i have a 500mb binary file. with a bunch of float entries. it was written by a c++ program. i would load it in c++ like this.         and i can access the float values: data[x]; in c++ it works preatty fast. is there something simular in java?     edit  after reading a bit around i have this so far:         which prints the  first  float entry. now i should loop float by float and put it in an array like  .

 in my application (java) i need to support two types of rpcs:  administration rpc and user rpc. i am using avro to create these rpcs  currently i am opening two httpservers one per rpc using code similar to the following:         this works  but it look like a waste for me - i am looking for a way to use a single http server with two ports or two urls on the same port (any of these options is good for me)  something like:         the addresponder method does not exists of course  the only method that looks similar is the addconnector method - but even after thorough googling i couldn't find how to apply it to my needs..     is there a way to start two avro responders on the same http server?

 i will start by saying that i have had no trouble running a java application outside of eclipse that contains and starts silk even when eclipse is not running. i am attempting to convert my application to a servlet and run it on apache tomcat 6. tomcat is located on my local machine and so is eclipse. i have no problems running the servlet when the server is started from inside of eclipse. when i deploy the servlet to tomcat  it runs just like it should and everything works perfectly up to the point where it attempts to start openagent.exe. my code errors when it attempts to initialize the desktop class which i am assuming includes starting open agent. i have attempted to pass the location of open agent into the desktop class in many forms but it still errors at the same point. i have made sure to include all of the .jar files that i need. my servlet directory includes my web-inf --> lib folder which includes silktest-jtf-nodeps.jar. my class folder includes my silk4j.settings file. in case this matters  i deployed my servlet by exporting my project into a .war file and used tomcats management page to deploy the .war file for me. i am aware of a file called agent.properties but i do not know what to do with this file. below is the error that i am receiving.    failed to start /agent/openagent.exe after a timeout of 180 seconds.    java.lang.runtimeexception: failed to start /agent/openagent.exe after a timeout of 180 seconds.     com.borland.silktest.startservice.startservice.waitforapplication(startservice.java:256)     com.borland.silktest.startservice.startservice.startsynchron(startservice.java:111)     com.borland.silktest.jtf.internal.agent.connectagent(agent.java:276)     com.borland.silktest.jtf.internal.agent.connect(agent.java:209)     com.borland.silktest.jtf.internal.agent.connect(agent.java:184)     com.borland.silktest.jtf.desktop.(desktop.java:96)     echo.echoservlet.doget(echoservlet.java:30)     javax.servlet.http.httpservlet.service(httpservlet.java:617)     javax.servlet.http.httpservlet.service(httpservlet.java:723

 i am working on an application that needs to print directly to an esc/pos printer.  printing is fine  however when issuing commands to the printer they just print!! i'm trying to convert some c# code and the commands i'm trying to send are hex strings as follows:         of course i understand that there are illegal escape characters in this so i changed it to:         i then converted to a byte array and tried sending it via a dataoutput stream like so:         but it just prints it on the other end;    could anyone offer any advice on this id greatly appreciate it.  
 for a project at work i need to generate a pdf file from html. i'm using itext (java) for this but i'm experiencing problems when trying to hide some elements.    the html is generated by some rich text element  an example of the htlm output that needs to be parsed:     html                  to hide the elements i'm using following simple css file:     css          problem is  this just doesn't work. although  when i change the css file to this:         it does change the font-size to 30px. i've also tried some other methods like visibility: hidden  width: 0  ... but none of them do what i want.    are display and visibility not supported or is there something i'm missing here?    i've uploaded a little test project so it's easier to see what's going on and more importantly  what goes wrong.     pdftest project   
 i'm writing some code and wondering if its bad design to throttle a loop by calling   at the beginning of each iteration. my other option is calling   fewer times at longer intervals but that is not optimal to what i'm coding. does anyone know if i should be concerned with the overhead of resuming/pausing a java thread at very rapid intervals when using    is there another alternative i should be looking at? - duncan krebs    here is my use case in more detail:     i have a back testing data feed that iterates through a large list of quote objects and i want to throttle the speed at which the quotes are consumed so i can speed up or slow down time in my back test. for starters i don't see another option other than thread.sleep()  if that is the case then i can either sleep after each quote is consumed for a very small time or batch consume a collection and then sleep before consuming the next batch. the rest of the framework i have for understanding the tick data operates best if i can throttle this consumption thread 1 quote at a time  hope this makes sense!  
 i want to develop an android application.    when installing the application  i do not want that the application logo added in the \"applications\" menu neither in the \"home\". i want that my application run as a daemon and configurable from the \"settings\" and could stop/start it from the \"settings\" too    is it possible to do that with android?

 this a legacy system so please don't tell me what i'm trying to do is wrong. it has to be this way.    i have a byte array where date is put in a sequential manner. this is fine until i want to store a value above 255. to do this i need to use 2 bytes as a 16 bit value.    so i need to convert an int into two chars and then the two chars back into an int.    one program is in c and the other in java and they communicate through a byte array.     this seems to me like a problem that should have been fixed a long time ago so i'm wondering if there is a function for doing this in the java and c libraries. if not  is there an easy way of making the conversion?

 i'm enduring this exception and after reading around i understand you can usually deal with it by using an iterator. but having tried that i find it doesn't work in this scenario  perhaps because i have two nested loops? all the code is running on the main thread (android).         i'm relying on object references to identify objects  so copying collections is a very unattractive option. is there any way to do what i need to do without resorting to copies?     ===== working code =====    i actually made three mistakes that are fixed here. 1. i used the same iterator in both loops (fixed in the code above too) 2. i should have used iterator.remove() 3. within removeroute() there was another (unnecessary) for loop looping through routes to delete similar siblings       
 i am using tanuki service wrapper (version 3.2.0) and oracle jvm 1.6-13 and want to define an environment variable (date_time= 'date +%y-%m-%d-%h-%m') and reference the environment variable in the wrapper conf. the reason is because i want to append a date time to the gc.log generated by the jvm using this property         the gc.log is always overwritten whenever jvm is restarted. to avoid jvm to overwrites the file that contains valuable information  i have to append the date time to it to avoid it to be overwritten during restart.    my search hasn't returned anything satisfactorily. if you have any suggestions  please let me know.    thanks.   
 i'm using mvc to organise an maths game application that has multiple classes that are the following:       : main class. currently holds cardlayout which screen classes are contained in and runs the application along with other controller-like actions.    : implements components and contains methods for use on the difficulty selection screen. is extended from   and is essentially a mix of a model/view.    : implements components and contains methods for use on the game screen. is extended from   and is essentially a mix of a model/view.    : implements components and contains methods for use on the end game screen. is extended from   and is essentially a mix of a model/view.    : extends   and sets layout to   and adds a matte border.    : is implemented by       and   and contains   variables and an  .      i've watched some tutorials and read up on mvc  but a lot of the resources i've found on it deal with very basic programs; having one model  one view  one controller  and a main class.    i have an idea of how i must go about refactoring my program to work with mvc  but i'm unsure about a couple of things.       am i right in saying that from what classes i have above  i should split       and   into model and view classes for each? additionally  would it be better to create one controller class oras i've seen suggestednot bother and instead combine it with my main   class? an approach i was suggested to use in a previous question  here  whereby i could implement a controller interface seems useful too  but i'm not exactly sure if/how that would work with my new code.     would it be helpful/needed for a project this small to split the model  view  and controller classes into their own sub-packages and keep   in the main package?        further clarification:     i'm essentially wondering if having these classes would be a good implementation of mvc:       : as a main class  or possibly being my controller. could also possibly implement a controller interface as suggested in the linked answer above.    these 3 possibly being inside their own sub-packages  let's say                       these 3 possibly being inside their own sub-packages  let's say                       : won't be needed if mathsgame is both my main class and controller class. could be in its own sub-package   if needed.               additional:       i've looked up on model-view-presenter. it looks to be similar and better suited to whole applications. it seems these questions are valid for that too. if this would be more fitted to what i want to do  i would be okay with that too.      i'm hope i've explained myself well enough. it is for a college project but i missed a lot last year due to illness so i'm a bit confused on these aspects. if i can clarify any part better  please leave a comment. thanks in advance for any suggestions!

 in short i want to create  edit and delete rules from a rules repository at runtime.  i'm having trouble figuring out how to do this in drools 6+.    i know in a previous version of drools (&lt;= 5.6)  that there was an xml representation of a .drl file and an api for working with it:  https://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/5.6.0.final/drools-expert-docs/html/ch04.html#d0e8052 .    the drools documentation as of 5.6 indicates this deprecated and it appears to be completely removed at 6.    i don't want to use an api that is already known to have no direct upgrade path.    exposing the guvnor or workbench uis to users for rules editing is also not a good fit here due to workflow requirements and due to the complexity of the web user interfaces.  i want to create and manage the rules from java code.    i want a better method than string templating to a .drl file for creating new rules and modifying rules.  what exists for programmatically creating new rules from java?  i have done a lot of searching but can't seem to find a set of java api calls for this.  
 i'm using datehistogram aggregation in elasticsearch  via java api  but  even if i add a postfilter with a specified from-to timeframe  the query returns data histogram on all documents in the index.    the code i'm using:         and  the aggregation:         the datarangefilter works well with hits and other aggregations; instead it doesn't work only for datehistogram aggregation. how can i filter the timeframe of datehistogram?  
 i start to learn anroid development using android studio  so when i apply what is in the run app page (android 5.0):  https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app.html  i get         i searched here and i found that i should install: intel x86 emulator accelerator(haxm installer)  i download it but the problem is that my cpu does not support intel virtualization technology. so how can i run apps without it. please help i'm stack. thanks

 is it possible to inspect data type of value while iterating through  ?          the map has a combination of      and   types as values. i would like to determine the data type of the value at runtime and properly cast it.   
 i am using   to find the maximum value in the list but the code below returns   though the max value is  .       
 i am developing an android app  i have run into a situation where the app will use an api to send some data to the php webservice and the webservice will greate some json encoded message which will be echoed back.    my question is       how do i store this json message that was sent by php echo into a variable in the android app?   how do i then go about parsing the json and use the data to construct a switch case?      i had raised a similar question sometime back and was told to use   but what i don't understand is why would i need to use it.    the sample json response that will be sent by the phpwebservice is         i want to be able to get the error variable and decide if there is any error and also get the message in a variable and display it to the user in the app.    i currently have the android signup.java code like this         while this checks the http header code and might work( i havent tested it out) i want to use the jsnon response and do the handling using it.  
 first of all i am referring to this question ( link ) which did not help me because then versions of frameworks were lower so i am starting new question.    so i am using grails 2.4.3 framework and trying to use drools rule engine inside it. java version is 1.0.8_20 and groovy version is 2.3.9. dependencies in buildconfig are:         in this line of code :         i get this exception:         i've tried to change versions of drools-core/knowledge-api to higher (up to 6.0.1.final) but keep getting the same error. i've also tried to import this strange xjc dependencies as mentioned in post that i was referring in the beginning but with no success.    does anyone knows what is the solution to this problem?    btw full stack trace is :       
 i am using an   with a  . i create threads by implementing the   interface. in the   method  i am calling a time consuming function (let's say   for now) and finally add an element to a thread safe  . i am submitting threads in a for-loop. at the end of the for-loop i shutdown the   and await termination.    however  the number of elements in the list does not turn out to be the same as the number of loop-iterations. where is my mistake in concurrency thinking?    here is a code example for this problem:

 i have a webapp with wicket ui  where i'm trying to start a background job  so i inject an asynchronous bean (don't want the ui to block). to update my status when the bean finishes i push the message to the ui with websockets.    bean code snippet for message push:         the problem is that i'm getting the following error when the message should show up in the ui:         using wildfly 8.1.0.final  weld cdi 1.1  java 1.7.    repository:  https://github.com/claudiu-stanciu/wicketcdi_test/tree/asynccdi     tried to recreate the context inside the bean with deltaspike  then call listener.onmessage() -> nothing. tried to use a runnable.run() with executorservice instead of asynchronous and then call websockets onmessage -> contextnotactiveexception.    some help would be welcome.  
 i have class:         annotation   works on jboss 7.1  on wildfly 8.1 not.    if   is removed  code works also on wildfly.    why?     thank you.  
 i have to write a program that will read a picture and then print out the number of blocks inside it.    i have to read the picture as a binary matrix of the size r  c (number of rows times number of columns). the blocks are groups of one or more adjacent elements with the value 1.       blocks are built exclusively of elements with value 1   each element with value 1 is a part of some block   adjacent elements with value 1 belong to the same block.  we only take into account the horizontal and vertical adjacency but not diagonal.      input:    in the first line of the input we have the integers r and c  separated with one space.  then we have the r lines  where each contains s 0's and 1's. the numbers inside the individual lines are not separated by spaces.    the output only print the number of blocks in the picture.    for example:     example 1     input:         output: 6     example 2:     input:         output: 7    the problem:    the problem that i have is that my program only works for inputs such as in example 1. so pictures that only consist of blocks of size 1. but it doesnt work if there are multiples 1's in a picture  such as example 2.    in example 2 where the output should be 7(blocks are elements of 1.they can either be vertial or horizontal).... my programs output is 30.    i don't know how to adjust the program in a correct manner so it will give me the correct input.    thank you for your help in advance  here is my code that i am posting bellow.       
 i need allocate file with size near 50 gigabytes  but this code:         throws exception:         : attempting to move the file pointer before the beginning of the file.    when i trying allocate 50 megabytes  such exception not throws. free space of disk is much greater then needed file size.  
 i've been facing a design issue that i find hard to even explain  which is probably why google has been of little help to me  so bear with me on this one.    i'm trying to build a hierarchical structure to help with developing an application. the hierarchy consists of the name of a network request  and inside i'd have the parameters needed and the fields that it would return. the goal would be the convenience and error checking of an ide to code things in the following manner (pseudo-code):         not only the code completion would help in getting to know exactly which parameters were needed  but this would also have the added benefit of errors being highlighted if i were to copy and paste this code  since changing the request variable would highlight all the elements that don't belong to the new type of request.    my first attempt was to use enums  but i can't seem to have enums embedded in other enums  so i made an attempt of using classes with enums in them. however  i can't access an enum from an instance of its class  so if i were to duplicate the example above to change the value of the    i'd have to add the specific request's class in each line that references that request  so that i could access the enums. therefore  unlike the first example  the ide wouldn't spot the mistake in the last line of the example below:         i've been going back and forth between different approaches and i don't feel satisfied with any. i also feel like i'm attempting to reinvent the wheel. so my question is  is there a design pattern that tackles this specific problem  or are there other techniques/technologies that i should be considering?  
 i need to refresh some variables set by a constructor  therefore i thought about recalling it.    how do i do this within a method in the same class? i would like to keep the same instance.             constructor call must be the first statement in a constructor      it seems i could only do this within another constructor  at its first line.  
 i just started studying the  android development tutorial on youtube . when i was implementing the crazytipcalc.java  eclipse reported the following error:         the following is the code of crazytipcalc.java  the  last 6 lines  of which has the \"r.menu not resolved\" problem. i imported com.example.crazytipcalc.r before building the project already. why does this problem occur and how to fix it? thank you.       
 i have been working on a save and load method. its aim is t save a game classes state and then return that saved game when loadboard is called.  when i load the game it returns a blank java window. there are no errors thrown.         save method:         load method:         gameboard class:         }    can someone help me to return the games saved state?  
 i am using two java list objects that contain some data.    the first list contains all the data objects inside it and teh second one contains some of the data(not all) from the original list.    the original list itself is a static object that can be accessed .    here is the code below that copies the whole contents of the original list into a new list and then ammends the copied list my removing certain elements.    the issue i am having is that it seems to effect and remove same elements from the original list!       
 following the answer on my previous question ( add a new data type to pentaho kettle )  i added a plugin with a custom datatype. now i have a step where i need to access this custom data type from valuemeta as in valuemeta.type_customtype for the getfields() method. i can't get that to work. your ideas would be appreciated.    ps: i cannot have the code for the custom dt in the step code as the same dt would be used by several steps.    thanks.  
 i have an idea to create an application using spring framework  so that a user should be able dynamically to create forms and use them after to enter data in database. i have an idea to integrate openoffice base form in my application and postgresql as database. the idea is that the user has a button or a link that can open openoffice base  so that he create his forms and after creating that he should be able to save the created forms and so the forms would be accesible throught web.    any other idea how can someone realise that using java is welcomed     thank you in advance    jack  
      this feels like a really basic question  but are 0 argument mutators frowned upon? i feel like i rarely see methods within an object that directly manipulate one or more of the object's parameters directly in a predefined way. perhaps (as shown above) you need to do some repeatable code sections in a different order  and so create methods for each scenario encapsulating the more finely grained methods? if this is considered bad  what is a better way of doing it  and if not  why do i never see it done?    another example could be (incomplete)         this changes an objects state  is exposed to the user  and takes no argument. is this allowable? is there a name for this sort of method  that performs a set task on an instance that changes the state and takes no argument?    thanks  
 i am developing a shoot'em up type video game using java swing and i'm using a java swing timer to control all of the screen updating.  the main screen uses a borderlayout  and i perform my graphics on a panel contained within the borderlayout  and use the awt graphics calls to draw.    now as my game progresses  i would like to speed up the movement of my screen objects (ships)  yet i still want them to smoothly cross the screen.  i thought i could speeed things up by dropping the timeout value for the java swing timer  down to around 5ms.  but  i've noticed when i set it to anything less than 15ms  there does not seem to be much difference.  once you cross that threshold  there is almost no noticeable difference in performance.  -why is that?-    another option would be to increase how many pixels each ship moves per update  but anything beyond 3 or 4 pixels  and things start to look jumpy.    any ideas?  and really want to keep the game in swing  would prefer at this point not porting to a 3rd party library.    thanks.  
 i'm developping an android application which  among other things  uses the method tolongarray from java.bitset. as can be seen  here   this method was introduced in android api level 19  android 4.4. lint in eclipse correctly warns me about that  because my minsdkversion is 10  but i can configure it so it doesn't complain.    when doing so  i could build by project and run it: in android 5.0 it works  in android 2.3 (api level 10) it doesn't  but surprisingly  in android 4.0.3  4.1.2  4.2 (which are below api level 19) it works like a charm  even though it shouldn't work. the same happens even if i set min/target sdk to 15 (android 4.0.3).    the same happens for object.hashcode  for example  and i can't figure out why it works.  
 i have   variable from java (for example   )  that stores some   expression  lets say    it is absolutely dynamic string from user input  i can't know  how many   will be there.    and i want not to use it in   with evaluated   by current binding using  .     the problem is:       if i won't convert   to   somehow  it will throw    because without   we need use quotes around  . but it is unsafe  and groovy generates warnings (that we should use   and remove quotes).   if i will convert   to   this way:    then groovy will use absolutely wrong prepared statement that contains just    of course  it won't work  i need statement:  .       the question is  how can we get   from   without wrapping it with  ? or how can we evaluate only first level of   (only    not  )? or how can i solve this problem in the other way?    thank you.  
 consider an object list of item where each item is associated with an integer field:         i want to filter out a list with the items that have the maximum value. in that case since the maximum number is 9  i will receive  . my way of doing this is having to iterate the whole list first  then store the maximum value (9) somewhere and then iterate it again and add the items which have their field equal to 9 to a new list.    but this is a lot of code everytime i want to do something similar  and doesn't seem very efficient. is there a better approach (either in terms of efficiency or tidyness)?  
 what i'm trying to do is to create a content in a specific file  where i can add stuff inside that content from other files  so imagine that the following code is in the footer.vm         and in the header.vm i do the following         so that script tag will be rendered inside the footer.vm    and if i do the following in the sidebar.vm         then in the footer.vm will have both scripts (they should not overwrite each other)    the syntax may be wrong  also i don't have any previous experience with java (i'm the front end guy here)  so if is there a way i can do this only with velocity it would be great!    if there's none  then can i do it along with java?    thanks!  
 canvas provided by swt offers only int coordinates. it is enough for simple task  but sometimes the floating point precision is needed. of course  the number of pixels would stay the same  but it is possible to create an illusion of point being \"between the pixels\" by using different shades of original color and proper antialiasing. but implementing such rendering mechanism is nontrivial. i wonder if there are any third party solutions already avaiable/recommended?    (so far only found  swtgraphics2d from piccolo )

 i have to make a program that allows the user to enter integer numbers until he press '0'. the program has to print: 1)the total number of the entered numbers 2) the number of the positive ones 3) the average of the positive ones 4) the number of the negative ones 5) the sum of the negatives    so far  all i could do is make the \"enter untill '0' is pressed\" and find the number of the entered numbers  which is a lot for me and my programing skills. i am having troubles trying to find out if the number is positive or negative. probably i am not comparing them right  so i would love if i get a little help from someone advanced.    here's my code so far:       
 i am absolutly new in liferay portlet development using  struct 2 .    i have some doubts about how to pass values (a model object) between the controller and the jsp page.    so for example i have this  controller class  for my portlet:         and this is the portlet jsp:         and this is the mapping inside the  struts.xml  configuration file:         that map the portlet request to the  starttest()  method of my  testportlet1action  controller class.    now my doubt is. how can i pass a model object from my controller to my view?    tnx   
 i am trying to implement this logic where in i am creating a new instance of the message if the size exceeds 10000 characters.the type of message will be an xml with header &amp; footer.i need to ensure that i create a new instance every time the message size crosses 10000 characters.i am not able to think where to start.can anyone give lead/pointers that can get me started. by the way the xml will be generated at run time.    added note:     thanks thomas for the reply.i'll just try and explain how the xml will be formed.the xml will have it's header &amp; footer which will be fixed.but it'll comprise of one component which will look something like this apart from the normal header &amp; footer :    {4: :20:xie180215usd001 :12:101 :77e:20110614bkchmyklxxx0000100001cny00002000000000010000 00  pbbemyklxxx8990612000072  00000000200000 00000000030000 00a  mbbemyklxxx8990592000072   -00000000100000 00000000025000 00ryn  -}    so here in field 77e after the  first line there will be repetition of line 2 &amp; 3.this needs to happen till the entire size doesn't exceed 10000 characters.i'll then have to stop and then create a new fresh xml.the problem here is how do i count the size of entire xml.should i count it in the end/should i count it after every iteration of field 77e.also i need to consider the size of the header and footer.after consolidating i  will need to have to check for if the size doesn't exceed 10000 characters.also i've another blockade.since these are all strings i can use the string.length() method to find the length.but how do i convert the same in char.is that the right thought process.please help me.i'm just a bit confused here. @thomas @stephen c   
 i'm trying to retrieve some data from my db (i'm using sqlite) using dao         all i'm getting is a list of objects like         what should i do in order to get the values instead? thank you in advance.  ps: if you want to see more code  let me know  
 in all related discussions  people mentioned get/setmobiledataenabled is private function and needs to be accessed by using reflection. for example  this one  android: how to tell if &#39;mobile network data&#39; is enabled or disabled (even when connected by wifi) .     however  i found the settings app (package/apps/settings/src/com/android/settings/datausagesummary.java) does not use reflection at all. anybody knows the reason?       
 we have an web application running with tomcat in a microsoft azure environment. we are not using any native libraries or external dlls in our code.    from time to time the jvm crashes with          looking at the hs_err_pid files it looks like the error is triggered by generating pdf using the itext library used in the web application.    typically such events are listed in \"compiliation events\" in the pif files:         we are not able to reproduce the problem even by using all available parameters used by our customer. between the occurrences of this problem sometimes weeks ore months pass. but if the problem occurs on one cluster node and the load balancer redirects the current web application user to the second cluster node the problem occurs on this node also  so no running nodes are left and the web application is not available anymore.    we have no session replication between the nodes  so a redirected user has to log in again on the second node. but it seems that something in the environment let the user action make crashing the second node also.    we have already tried without success to solve this problem by switching the jvm versions  even downgrading from 1.7 to 1.6 and also changing tomcat versions.    according to this bug  http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6961186    the error is caused by native code. the windows event logs on the servers do not show any error at the time the error occurs.    does anyone has an idea how the root cause of this problem can be found?    christoph    following a complete hs_err_pid file

 i'm creating an app  where user is communicating with server  both using http and sms.  when i want to push a message to user  server is trying to do that using gcm... when there is no answer from user device - send sms.     i'm trying to implement the part where user is registering to gcm (and to my server). now  how should i handle the part  where user is not connected to network? normally i would block app until onsuccess method... however  app still functions on sms (i use broadcastreceiver for that).    so  my plan is to let user use my app  but to create a service somewhere in the background  waiting for internet connection to finally finish the registration process. is this a good approach?    public class registerservice extends service {         my app compiles and works - i get network changes.  however for some reason i get those messages no matter what. i'm not sure is it because of the method itself  or because i don't fully understand both services and broadcastrecievers.  
 i'm trying to inject a spring-managed bean and a string value into a servlet. the servlet is defined in   as following:         i came across using this method:         this works  but has some disadvantages:      i want to inject beans as defined in   and not per autowiring   i need to inject a string value (not a bean)  which seems impossible this way      ideally i want that all values defined in xml will be somehow injected into servlet instance.  
      if i pass   and a regex for   in above snippet  i get all logs files for all dates  but i want the result to get trimmed down to today's date files only. can i get this done with java 7 after i get the whole list above  or is there a better way altogether?    i will run this on unix box with jdk 1.7_71 64 bit jvm.  
 i am trying to create a database and import some data i have in an excel spreadsheet straight into it. the spreadsheet has around 65 500 rows and 14 columns so it is a fair amount of data.     so far i have       installed and setup oracle 11g r2   created a database which is currently empty   used enterprise manager to create a new tablespace with 5 gb space and privileges   installed sql developer and connected to the database with two connections (one user and one admin (system account))   i have also increased the vm in both sqldeveloper.conf and the ide.conf      the problem i am having is that once i right click tables (filtered) and try to import data  once i go through the dialog box and define all the column types and space for them  the process fails and i get an error saying  import data into table suppperf from file supplier performance data.xls . task failed and import rolled back. i also get java heap space and gc overhead limit exceeded.    any ideas on what is happening and how i can retify this?  
 i have a getter method like below:         message.properties has         but even if i keep the customerid as blank or empty  it always displays the message ship to account must be a valid number   it never displays customer id required message.  
 i would like to show the data from the div    from the following page          and i am using asynctask class to load and show the data in the webview but my output is nothing but a blank screen          i have tried other divs too but all i am getting is a blank screen and i have no idea it is not loading properly. what am i doing wrong ?    if i try to load meta data then the code works fine   for example          and then display   then it works          why the meta displays but the divs data doesnt ?  
 i have one main project and 2 other projects that the main one will use. the 2 projects are packaged into a   file.     in the main project  i am placing these 2 jar files into  . i have the following in the  :         i then run the command:      when i refresh the project in eclipse and look at the project properties    is under the library tab and   is under the projects tab and saying \"missing\".    why would there be a difference? is it how the jar files are created?    thank you again so community for the help!     update    i looked at the   file and see that the   is putting the   in incorrectly.       
 i am quite new to spring and meet some difficulties configuring spring security rules.    here are my rules :         i just added the third one  and when starting the server  it yield a quite strange exception from my point of view :          as you can see  it come from         to         i suppose there is a kind of bad interraction between the rules  but i can't figure out what happens exactly.  
 is there an easy way to get the native sizeof(int) from the java vm running on a particular platform?   the value i want is not integer.size  in particular - the size of a java int  but rather what you'd get from sizeof(int) in c on the platform.    i need this because i'm using a particular library that reads and writes binary files  and trying to parse those files  whose interpretation depends in a particular way on the size of the machine int.  i'd like it to be portable.    i get the impression that including jna will give me that capability - but i'd rather not have to include a native library dependency (again  portability)  and i don't want to play nasty games like the only solution i could come up with offhand - allocating many direct int buffers and looking at management/memory metrics before and after.   that's a hack and not reliable...  
      i understand this code very well   and what i understand is that reference variable \"o\" refer to data of \"object\" type and as we can see student is extending from \"object\" which means that it refers to an instance of student. and if i wrote the following code :          this will assign the value in o into x   which means if we followed the direction of x we will go to that student object above !     my question here is   why can't i write the following code? :         \"o\" refers to an object of \" object \" type and that object assigns it's address ( in memory ) into \"o\"   why can't we assign that value saved in o into x !  
 is it possible to have self-signed applets without restrictions in local network? i can configure my user's pcs since they are all in lan.    the idea is that i self-sign applet  and out it department edits client's pcs  so that they auto trust our applets.    is this possible  or are there any restrictions?

 i'm working on a java library in scala. there's an abstract class in java:         and i've tried to impl a sub-class in scala:         so the problem is that the type parameter is kind of 'lost' in the scala sub-class. the   variable is not recognized as a string.    i've seen the blog by jeff hodges at  http://www.somethingsimilar.com/2011/01/13/tricky-things-in-scala/    and tried:         but same problem persists.     any suggestions?     thanks!  
 part1 of the webapp creates session1  and use session1 through those pages. when we call another sub part of the app  ex: part0.5  it still uses session1  and comes back with session1 to part1.    then  the webapp goes into another part  part2  permanently leaving part1  still with session1. in part2 of the webapp  as soon as we call another part of the app  ex part0.5  it uses a new session  session2. when it comes back to part2  its back on session1. as soon as it leaves for another part  part0.5 part 0.6  or even part 1  it is again with session2.    however  if we leave part2 and gives the jsessionid of session1  they do arrive with session1 on part 0.5  0.6  1...    we're using spring and everything scoped to prototype.

 i am working on fixing the following project:  objloader     it works well  loading in an obj i found.    however  the project was missing code to deal with mapping a texture onto the object  so i have been adding it in.    i can now load my obj (a banana) and i can in fact see a texture on it!    but  the texture is not mapped properly. it appears to be tiled and distorted (see below)         below is my code:    tdmodel.java         myrenderer.java         any ideas why its not wrapping correctly?    here is the texture

 i'm trying to run a native executable from java using the     api. the native code performs a long-running computation  which might have to be interrupted after a time-out.    ideally  i'd like to receive the standard output using   avoiding an intermediate file.    here is the conundrum:      it is not possible to  first  wait for the process termination and  then  starting to read stdout. in that case    waits indefinitely.   if i  first  start reading stdout and  then  check the exit code  the code stops responding to  . to see the issue  see the following minimal example:      bash code in   that simulates a long-running (5 seconds) computation:         java code in   that runs the bash code in a separate thread and interrupts it after 1 second:         ideally  the java code should print   and exit after 1 second. in fact  it waits all 5 seconds and eventually prints  .    any help?

 a legacy system using spring and jpa often hang time by time. here is the problem i found. in the spring config show below fitapdao is been injected into acpmsamplecollectschedule class  which has jpa entitymanager         below is the code in acpmsamplecollectschedule class just show rewrite version for demonstration purpose.         we can see above that fitapdao is using in a multithread situation. in this case the system hang itself after running for a while. i think it is the because that jpa's entitymanager is not thread safe and my question how to change this to avoid system hang? we still want to using spring and jpa framework. thanks  
 i'm using a crash report library in my android project. once activated  it reacts to every uncatched exception and creates a report just before the app shutdown.    so far so good  but i want to add more \"control\" to this thing and create reports for non-exceptions too. my idea is to define a \"fake\" exception this way:         so  when i want to send a non-fatal error message and create a report  i'll do this:         if called from the main thread  this obviously makes the app crash. so  i tried to throw it  on a background thread !         a great idea? no. the app crashes anyway (but the fake crash report is sent as expected). is there another way to achieve what i want?

 i wrote this small test application to demonstrate the problem  that is the searchable activity is not started when the user presses the search button on the keyboard.     i have been following the  developer guides   but from my web search   it turns out that the official developer guide misses some points.   from my so search (which did not help):         reference 1:  solved by adding  tag in the  element in the manifest. i also looked into the manifest of the sample \"user dictionary\" (i don't know where can i find the samples online  or i would link to it). this tag is there in the application element.      reference 2:  the \"android:label\" and \"android:hint\" in res/xml/searchable.xml must be references to string resources and not hard coded strings. mine are.      reference 3:  add a  tag with \"android:name=\"android.app.default_searchable\" \" (and \" android:value=\"&lt;. searchable-activity-name>\" \") in the manifest in the activity from where the search is going to be initiated. tried this  did not seem to work.      reference 4:  \"your searchable activity has to do something - and actually display results.\" mine does  it receives the intent with the action_search action  and passes the search query string retrieved from the intent to a method named \"performsearch(string)\" which displays the string in a textview.        so what am i doing wrong  and what can i do to solve this?       code:    mainactivity.java  - has a single searchview - the user enters the query and presses the search button on the keyboard.          testtwoactivity.java           res/xml/searchable.xml  - the searchable configuration          manifest file            layouts:       activity_main.xml           activity_test_two.xml              edit 1:  it's crazy that i wrote a similar app with the search dilogue instead of the search widget  that works perfectly.    i tried to debug it in eclipse but debugging stops because the   (the searchable activity) simply won't start.

 i have an app created by me. this app verify the current open apps. so  i open my app and put it on background  then i open the camera app manually. my app verify the opened apps. so  if the camera is open  it will take a pic  else it will do something else.    my problem is i open the camera manually. so  how i send a command to take picture without have opened the app on source?    i don't know if i explain it right. i don't open the app using code like this:  http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/camera.html     i opened it by my hand.  
 i try to get a local applet running on a local html page. i have put the file on the exception list as    file:///c:/work/test.html    i also tried simple things like    file://    i have checked that the java configuration is from the same version as the java plugin. the first version 1.8.0_25-b18 i took from the configuration tool and its button \"info\". the other from the java console. the plugin version is 11.25.2.18.    so far nothing worked. i always get an error message telling me (in german) that my security settings prevent the application of local applets.    what now?  
 i have a question regarding floating point arithmetic in java and its precision. i did do my research on here and via google and come across some solutions but am having difficulties implementing them in my design. so in java i am making use of the bigdecimal class in getting my calculations accurate. note that the variables are double and the values can have a precision up to 8 decimal places to the right when doing calculations. the result (precision) to display is known and thats what i'll be storing as the current value. also  all values come in dynamically (through a method). the argument passed should be the currentvalue + the step size.          }    now  it works with some values but not all. especially when i mess with the step size. so if step = 0.1 it was fine. if i made it 0.005  i'd get an airthmeticexception - non terminating decimal expansion on the step where         when .005 is set for the step variable  after making a bigdeciaml (stepbd) it comes out to .0049999999... not sure if that helps but if you have any ideas please let me know. thank you.  
 i want to get the number of entries where the score and date columns are in a given range  grouped by score intervals. score intervals are determined by the given granularity. so the question i want to answer is: how many results are there  for the given time period  with scores between 0-25  26-50  56-75  etc... where in this case  the granularity would be 25.    the following native sql query yields the desired results:         i'd like to define a query method with my own query  using   annotation.           is a simple bean  it is not an entity.   however is an entity  and it is backed by a view table.    i get the following exception:        org.springframework.dao.invaliddataaccessresourceusageexception: could not extract resultset; sql [n/a]; nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.sqlgrammarexception: could not extract resultset      hibernate api doc states:             implementation of jdbcexception indicating that the sql sent to the database server was invalid (syntax error  invalid object references  etc).      so  the question is: what is wrong with my query?  
 good day. i have next problem. we used fop 1.0  but then we have upgraded to v 1.1. and now i have the problem with image displaying in rtf file.    the error looks like:        org.apache.fop.render.rtf.rtflib.rtfdoc.rtfexternalgraphic$externalgraphicexception   the tag  does not support do?message=83720404 - image type.      this is the part of my template:         and this is the part of java code:         so  i need to receive the url another way? thanks.  
 in my web application i have multiple scheduled services which work on same entities ( like article  customer...etc). if i run a single service at time i've no problem  but when i run two services i get an error because the primary key unique constraint is violated.  as primary key i use a generated long value:         every service read data from a txt file  create its entities and every 20 entities execute a flush on hibernate session followed by a clear. only at the end of the execution of the service the session is committed.    how can i solve?  
 a desktop application stores its data in a xml file. this xml file  together with other files gets stored in a zip-archive to persist its state. ive always been at daggers drawn with encoding  but this time i really dont understand  why its not working. following problem:    when i persist the data in the xml file  everything seems fine. i log the output and all encodings are correct. i can open the zip with other tools checking for the xml and the encoding is fine there as well  but as soon as i try to read it in again in my java application  the encoding gets messed up  like for example german umlauts are not correct anymore.    following code is used to read in the xml from the zip:         can anyone see  what my mistake is here? how to maintain the correct utf-8 encoding  or can anyone think of any other reasons what could cause the encoding to break?  
 i have a few thousand strings that look something like this      foo-bar-herp     foo-bar-derp   baz-blurb something else      i'm want to provide a search that works so that       \"foo bar\"   (tokenized prefix)    \"foo herp\"  (skips a token)   \"foo-bar-\"  (exact prefix)   \"bar-herp\"  (exact string in the middle)   \"foo ba\"    (one whole token and prefix of another token)      etc.  all return the first string (and possibly others)  but       \"herp foo\" (wrong order  not critical)    \"foo blerp\" (not all tokens)       \"murp herp\" (not all tokens)      do not.    i.e. both exact prefix match and token (potentially prefix) matches in the right order should match  independent of case  but all tokens in the query must be in the document.     i've set up the typical lucene example using a standardanalyzer and a common queryparser with a prefix query.    i figure i might need a binaryquery to state that i need all tokens in the query to be in the documents but i can't quite figure to get at the tokens to build it (the query is user-supplied). i also realize that using a stringfield instead of a textfield gives me the exact string matches as opposed to the token-wise matches  but i'm not sure if that's something i can combine with the above?     how should i go about this? i don't even have to use lucene to do it  but it looked like a good fit.   
 we use hazelcast in client-server mode. the hazelcast cluster contains 2 hazelcast nodes and we have about 25 clients connected to the cluster.     what i am lookin for now is a simple check that tries to figure out if the cluster is still alive. it should be a rather cheap operation because this check will occure on every client quite frequently (once every second i could imagine).     what is the best way to do so?   
 i am working on a project where i need to develop soap webservice consumers. the webservice provider endpoints are stored in database. at run time i need to load the one end point based on my logical conditions. i am even storing the payload in database. so how can i develope consumer at runtime based on the endpiont url and payload?    as a final conclusion my requirement is  i need to build a custom soap ui that handles any service. i have seen some help in stackoverflow  but no answer is accepted by any person.

 i have to perpare a trainging set for my machine learning course  in which for a given face image it gives you an answer representing the side of the head ( straight   left   right   up )    for this purpose i need to read a .pgm image file in java and store its pixels in one row of matrix x  and then store the appropriate right answer of this image in a y vector. finally i will save these two arrays in a .mat file.    the problem is when trying to read the pixel values from a (p2 .pgm) image and printing them to console   they don't give identical values with the matlab matrix viewer. what would be the problem?    this is my code:         these are the values i get: 50 49 32 50 32 49 32 48 32 50 32 49 56 32 53 57    while this photo is what is indeed in the image from matlab viewer: (sorry i can't post images because of lack of reputations)         and this is what you find when you open the .pgm file via notepad++       
 i'm writing a simple reverse proxy using netty. since i don't want to deal with the raw bytes myself i've added a request decoder and object aggregator to the handler pipeline  as well as a response encoder and finally my own handler  something like this         my   extends    so it has a          and a          what happens is that the server hangs wating if a request comes in that is larger than 1024 bytes (e.g. it has some cookies). with some trial and error i found that if i set the   on the handler everything works fine  so it looks like my old code was missing a   call somewhere  but i have no idea where. if i do something like         then i get exceptions inside the   that seem to be causes by dealing with a still incomplete http request  which kind of defeats the purpose of using a request decoder/object aggregator. what am i missing?

 what i want to do is  when i used an initialised   which i used to read the lines from a file using    when i reach the end of file i want to use the same   object to read lines from the beginnig of the same file for an example.    what i attempted to achieve this matter is  i used   and    after initialising the   i set   and i  read the entire file and after that i used   and agian read the entire file but then an exception was thrown. it seems that   only valid when the end of file has not reached.    is there any way to reset a previously initialised   to the beginnig of the stream?

 i am trying to configure spring boot using annotations. i have class          which contains this view resolver which works fine.         but after receiving name of jsp file application raise this error:  no mapping found for http request with uri [/web-inf/pages/mainpage.jsp] in dispatcherservlet with name 'dispatcherservlet'.     i found solution for xml configuration:         but i am using annotation configuration  so this soultion is not suitable for me.    i tried to resolve this problem extending abstractannotationconfigdispatcherservletinitializer         but nothing has changed after this. by the way i looked at few examples with abstractannotationconfigdispatcherservletinitializer  but i still don't understand how application can use this class when it's not annotated and no instances of this class are created. it's just declared and that's all. maybe i need to create an instance of this class and attach it anywhere?     anyway i see in log this line:  mapping servlet: 'dispatcherservlet' to [/]  so it looks like i have right servlet configuration.    i tried  this solution  but it doesn't help. i removed internalresourceviewresolver and created application.properties with such content:         but after that i received:  javax.servlet.servletexception: could not resolve view with name 'mainpage' in servlet with name 'dispatcherservlet'     so what is the proper way to resolve this problem?     update  i tried to create a new simple project from scratch.     pom.xml :          main.java :          application.properties :         project's structure:         i run project with command mvn spring-boot:run and receive  edu.test.main: started main in 2.365 seconds (jvm running for 5.476)  in output. but when i'm opening localhost:8080 i receive:         but now i'm not receiving \"no mapping found...\" error in output. when i am opening localhost:8080 nothing is printed to output at all. so what am i doing wrong?  
 i'm developing an java application. i'm using eclipse luna and gradle as my build-system. i can define dependencies in my build script and they get downloaded on a build. that's no problem... but how can i tell eclipse  that it should automatically download and add the dependency to my build path?    i wan't to use auto completion and so on  without manually downloading an jar and copy it to the project.    is it possible?    regards marc   
 suppose we have a  . one thread does         and another thread does         now  would it be  illegal  for a jit compiler to emit assembly corresponding to   instead of  ?    on one hand the very purpose of a volatile read is that it should always be fresh from memory.    on the other hand  there's no synchronization point between the two reads  so i can't see that it would be illegal to treat   atomically  in which case i don't see how an optimization such as   would break the spec.    references to jls would be appreciated.

 i am a newbie to this rest web services.  this question is already posted. but i cannot understand a thing. i have two questions here.       when we created a webapp with soap web services  we generated a test client to test it. is there a way we can test rest webservices? (using eclipse ide  generated test client in the following way. file---> new---> other---> web service---> web service client.  so  now how can i test restful web services? (i found one rest client tool  but i dont understand how to use that (newbie :)  ).     i need to find a way to give our war file to client as .exe file. i  didn't understand what exactly that meant  but here is the requirement.  \"we need to give our client this in the form of .exe file  like whenever we download some .exe file  it will ask us to run  accept license  browse destination  and such things. and also he shouldn't be able to see our code.\" this is what exactly our senior management told me and is there a way we can make it possible?? (i showed him the installjammer and then he said the client shouldn't see the code.)     
 for performance reason i want to inject implementation directly and avoid any spring interceptors to be called.    in my case i have pretty much single implementation so cha can kick in once any spring proxies removed.    i can't find any docs on how to do that and help will be appreciated.  
 i have a webservice response object that i want to process directly  and also execute a long running routine with it usinbg spring  .    problem: during the direct process i have to modify the object  and as it is    the modification is also reflected in the async process.    how can i prevent this?    example:         i know - for a simple list - i could basically clone the list and hand it to the async process.    but for a complex xml object with couple of nested lists (like 10 nodes or so - i don't have control over this)  this is probably a big mess as i must preserve the full content of the xml object.

 consider following part of code         i this case i am getting \"variable might already have been assigned\" on line b  which can be true if i had more lines in  block and exception was caused after my variable has been initialized. when i remove word   from line a it compiles ok  but i am getting warnings later in   block when i am trying to assign imagewidth/height (also final static) using   (of course if its not null). the warning is \"usage of non-final variable during initialization\". if i decide to use   in line a and remove line b  i am getting \"variable connectionimage might not have been initialized\" on line c.    my question is: is there a way to have static final variables initialized and usable in   block using functions that throws exception (or generally inside  ) or i should handle other way? (constructor)    note (if relevant): yes  the name of this class is to tell you it is inner class. also it is static because if it isn't i can't declare static fields inside.     i know how to write code which will do what i wan't  but i'd like to have this inner class because of my convenience and to separate some behaviors. i only wan't to know the static final  static block  try/catch situation. i couldn't find good exlpanation for this in google  i even checked my old 'thhinking in java'...    here is something similar  java - can final variables be initialized in static initialization block?  but author hadn't try to initialize variable in catch  also he is not using them in the static block after assignment so he is not getting \"usege of non-final...\" warning later.

 i have 2 tables a and b with  . when i query table a executes fine but not on table b    this is my query:         i use jdbc   and pass the argument through:  .     private java.sql.timestamp mytimestampvar;  mytimestampvar.tostring shows the value as '2014-11-26 00:00:00.0'    strange thing is that same application gets data from both tables in user testing  while it fails to do so in production even though it is the same jdbc driver on both environments.    i got oracle trace enabled and found that in table a timestamp is passed to the query as    while that in table b it is passed as  .    why would it is sending it in two different formats?  
 pre-compiled queries are compiled and cached in advance by db vendor (like oracle sql server etc) so that they can be faster for successive calls like prepared statement.    in hibernate named queries are said to be pre-compiled at web server start up. does it means all queries are fired at server startup itself so that they can be pre-compiled by db vendor or pre-compilation has different meaning in hibernate context?

 i have found some blog where there is a suggestion of avoiding   keyword while  creating object of a class. some examples of creating object without the   keyword are-         or using   method -          then  here  i have found some good examples of creating object without   keyword    i can understand the advantages of 'factory' pattern while avoiding 'new' keyword from main portion of code. if i am not using any design pattern (for creating objects) is there any benefit of creating object without the   keyword? or what are the reasons for creating of object without  ?  
 i'am creating header of the table dynamically. after filling the whole table with data  i need to get the sizes of the columns of the table and create the table header.  thanks  
 i recently faced one interesting question:    for example i have class a:         class a must exist only as singleton; so  to provide access to singleton i create class factory:         }    as i understand  according to reordering in jvm it's possible that in case if 2 threads access factory.geta() at the same time it's possible that one of threads will get partially constructed object and it can lead to application crash.    but in case if i make private a a; volatile can i be sure that each thread will access only completely constructed object?    so  as a conclusion  if i mark variable x as volatile  does it affect content of x.class constructor?  
 my requirement is to store an image array in db. while storing that image array  hibernate throws an exception   &amp; lot of stacktrace &amp; then  . my requirement is to increase packet query size of db when i encounter  . so i had taken two catch blocks of    and  .    but hibernate never throws packettoobigexception directly as like in jdbc. hibernate first throws   and then  . to overcome the scenario  in catch block i had written  .     1) am i going in right way?  2) or anybody can suggest me the better approach so that i can directly catch  . thanks for your time.  
 consider the following interface:         which is implemented by the following class:         although meth() is a method that throws an exception  the caller of the method meth() is not having to handle or declare the exception and yet the program runs successfully. why is this the case?  does it not violate the rule that whenever you call a method that throws an exception  you need to catch the exception or declare that you throw the exception yourself?

 i have written save / load methods (not sure entirely if the save works but the file 'minesweepersavestate.ser' appears in my project folder after calling  ). i want to try to get the load to work because at current it doesn't seem to do anything.    here are my functions:            how can i alter this method so that when i call the   method  it brings back the game in the state it was saved?    edit:    gameboard class:         }  
 either one or the other must be faster. which one? and most important  where is the  proof ?     background:     i'm asking because one of my methods  which receive a map as parameter and must invoke the method get on the map thousand of times  became slower after the map passed was changed from   to  ).  the keys used in the map are integers (and integer objects have an efficient implementation of hashcode and equals  before someone says that guava's immutable maps works well only if the keys have an efficient implementation of hashcode and equals).       collections.unmodifiablemap: answer computed in 1.386 s   immutablemap: answer computed in 4.628 s      if i am the only one experiencing this behavior  then i must try to find an answer myself.  if it is generally known that guava's immutable collections are slower (and if it is a proven fact)  then i can't stop trying to find problems in my code.     why i tried the change:      the documentation of guava's immutable collections states that         the jdk provides collections.unmodifiablexxx methods  but in our opinion  these can be ... inefficient: the data structures still have all the overhead of mutable collections  including concurrent modification checks  ...       ( https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/immutablecollectionsexplained )    but it is only the opinion of guava's authors  not a fact backed by measurements  that concurrent modification checks are inefficient.     if someone wants to try it:     here a simplified version of the method \"computesolution\" i have. note  however  that my question is not \"what is wrong with this program?\" but \"what is provably faster: guava immutable maps or jdk unmodifiable maps?\" if no one ever tried to measure the performance of guava's immutable maps  then the answer for my question is simply \"who knows?\"

 we are trying to upgrade a legacy application from hibernate 2.1.8 to hibernate 3.6.10. the application uses few classes written using hibernate 2.1.8 api to provide their own persistence mechanism. the problem is that hibernate 3.6.10 does not have those api's functions anymore and hence we need to rewrite the classes. can you help us in finding the appropriate matches in hibernate 3 for below :    hibernateproxyhelper.getlazyinitializer((hibernateproxy)object).isuninitialized()    you can see the code below          }    any help would be appreciated :)

 i got a problem here  we have an application which require specific fonts to be installed in windows and in some cases customers are missing them.  so it was decided to bundle them together with application and install if they are missing. so far im testing runnable jar where i include all required fonts (*.ttf) as resources and trying to install them from code    for example here i'm checking if required font is missing:         in function \"getlocalfonts\" im getting fonts from embedded jar resources as array of files         and registering them in the system with \"registerfont\" in \"installmissingfonts\" function         that works perfectly within a run time  and if i'll call check over again after registration was complete  it will not say to me that fonts are missing what is exactly what i need  however it is not installing them into c:\\windows\\fonts folder and those registered fonts are discarded after lunch time. so each time i would run the jar it will install those fonts but only for a duration of application live within its own virtual space. running it as admin on win7 doesn't help  it still working only for a duration of application live    question: how do i install missing fonts to the system (c:\\windows\\fonts) from java code if i have required fonts as *.ttf files embedded as resource?    thank you in advance!

 a load of tasks are submitted to my application but it keeps hanging and i track it down to this code:         it is basically an string matching algorithm in a 3rd party library but it does not throw  threadinterruptedexception  so does this mean i cannot interrupt it  but is certainly a long running process having run for 30 minutes. i have a reference to the thread monitoring this code but is there any way  to stop it .    of course i am looking to fix the 3rd party library but in the meantime i need a way to stop my application hanging by cancelling these hanging tasks. what makes it worse for me is that i use hibernate  and a hibernate session is created in this stack and then because this tokeniserwhitespace method never finishes my session (and hence database connection) is never released therefore eventually i ran out of database connections and the application completely hangs.

 i'm facing an issue with spring placeholder configuration. i've searched the web trying to find a solution but nothing worked for me at all.    we had used to use spring configurer for loading our .properties files and everything worked fine since the configfiles where located in meta-inf dir.     now we need to have our config files located in /etc/sep/properties directory or in some other filesystem directory.    i tried to use          the content of /etc/sep/properties/jdbc.properties is following:         i also tried using another approach as folows  but it worked for me neither.         i don't know if it matters but we are using maven building  so that the application-context.xml is placed in core-lib.jar which is used in our web-app as dependency. other config  such as logging work great.    i would be grateful for any suggestions.  
 in eclipse e4  i am trying to open a mpart under progress dialog(i.e. progress bar will be displayed untill mpart will not display/load the contents)  but i am getting below exception:         below is the code i am using to open the mpart:             ieclipsecontext servicecontext = e4workbench.getservicecontext();             final ieclipsecontext appcontext = (ieclipsecontext) servicecontext                     .getactivechild(); //$non-nls-1$         this is not a pure e4 application and i am using compat layer. if i am not using progress bar  the exception never occurs and mpart opens smoothly. so is there any way to open mpart if progress bar is displaying.  
 i have bumped into a weird problem in feature that works well on all other installations  but not for one particular client.    the \"feature\" involves an xpage with code in beforerenderrespons that picks up an uploaded file  gets filename etc and creates a context document. the context document is then passed as parameter to a java agent which process the file.    the java agent is set to run as web user and has allow restricted operations. as i said - it works in all installations at other clients  but fails all of sudden on one installation.     the only error message i get from beforerenderrespons event is \"error:exception occurred calling method notesagent.runwithdocumentcontext(lotus.domino.local.document) null\".  i have confirmed that the agent is found but it never gets called. i have also confirmed that the context document also exists. the server console says nada.    i have tested calling the agent with different run methods as in agent.run() but it does not make a difference.    now to the weird stuff - if i call a java agent that does not include a scriptlibrary it works! but as soon as i add a script library to the agent i get the error above.    why is that? any help or clue appreciated. it feels like i have missed a security setting somewhere.  the server doc includes the agent signer in \"sign agents to run on behalf of someone else\"  \"sign or run unrestricted methods and operations\" and \"sign or run restricted lotusscript/java agents\"    edit: tested using a \"pass-thru\" agent that calls my original java agent that contains script libraries and that works! the pass-thru agent doesnt contain any scriptlibrary and simply calls my java agent and passes on the context document.     even so - i still want to know why calling a java agent directy fails if it contains a script library.    /katarina

 i'm writing application with mbeans. i can call their methods using jconsole.    do you have any idea how to disable/enable calling method from mbean? for example i'd like to permit calling method when some condition is fulfilled.     i have an application with timer. i have a class that has a timer (that count from 0 to 100 in loop)  the class has also mbean (registers and uses it). i'd like to allow call methods on mbean (from jconsole) only if timer is between 0-50 and forbid when timer is between 51-100  
 i am going to create a program that keeps track of the balance on a bank account. the program shall use a loop that continues until the user choses to exit by answering   no   to the question   do you want to continue?  .    in the loop the user shall be asked to enter an amount (positive for deposit and negative for withdraw). the amount shall be added/subtracted from an account balance variable. all deposits/withdraws shall be saved as a  history  so that we can print it later. when the user choses to exit the loop the current account balance together with the account history (from the array/arraylist) shall be printed.      now  i want to use an array with ten slots for the history feature.        my question is how can i keep track of the all deposit  withdraw and current account balance (using an array with ten slots for the history feature) so that i can print it out while the user exits the program?      my code:    bankapp class:         askinguser class:

 i am working with code which makes use of  . i have a path like           which i see only as          in this example   or   is a path which can be different during runtime and which is irrelevant for me. the same applies for the last element in the path      what i would need is to iterate over elements between   and  . basically to  test each element in the path if it exists and if it is a file or  a directory or something else (it doesn't matter).    i am therefore looking for some elegant/simple and proper way to iterate over instance of  where i can access paths like these:         ideally in this case without the first 2 and the last iteration.     i am looking for a good solution using   and   and not the old way. i know i can achieve this  using old   api but i am interested in the proper way of using  .

 in httpclient 4.3  if you respect all the deprecations  you must build and configure your   using an   (documentation  here ). the methods are explicit  they seem easy to use  and   's interface  is clear. but maybe a tad too much.    in my own case  i have to inherit spring's   (documentation  here ). as a consequence  i can easily get the    but all i know about this object is that it implements the interface.    since the client is already built  and i do not know anything about its implementation  i cannot access methods such as    's     or     (though yes  i know  they are deprecated).    so  what would be the cleanest way of updating the settings of this   (the retry handler and request interceptor are those i am most concerned with at the moment)? should i...      ... savagely cast my client to    hoping i will always receive this implementation?   ... create a new   in my httpinvokerrequestexecutor's constructor  and get something like the example reproduced below? i might add that spring's constructor (in 3.2.4 at least) uses methods deprecated in httpclient 4.3 too. would there be any side effect i missed using this strategy?   ... do something i have not proposed yet?      custom constructor example:       
 i have created java    it runs perfectly if i set my  java(jre 8) security level    high   and add my  site url  in  exception site list .    but if we do not add site url in exception site list  java security exception comes as explained here :  add url in exception site list     i have created a signed applet using a third part certificate.    here is my manifest file after creating signed applet:    is there any option available to   by adding some changes in manifest file while creating signed applet  or any script  java code to avoid these popups without adding site url in exception site list?    or is it really  mandatory from java  that  we must need to add site url in exception site list to avoid such blocking error.      basically is there any option available to add our url in exception site list through manifest file or any java code ?            as i am getting self signed applet block issue though i have signed my applet with wildcard certificate.    thanks

 i've been trying to create a   file using some   images as custom icons for my buttons. in order to do this i want to use simple   class:         my problem  however  is that i can't access this class from my   package even though i added my   folder to the build path.  this picutre shows my current way of adding images - with a path in a constructor of an   object. this  sadly  doesn't exports pictures permanently to  .  what wrong am i doing? i'll be very grateful for any help from you!  
 i have this class:         this class should be extended by another class to inherit it's attirubtes and methods. so this should be allowed:         but i don't want another developers to create inner classes (anonymous classes) from my mainclass  like this:         is there a way to do it in java?  
 i would like to test my thumb generator which retuns byte[] of content in \".png\". the test would generate a thumb and then display the thumb image. for example:         does anybody knows any convienient util class/library to achieve this in that way?    i know that i could achieve this by creating jframe and so on... but i don't want to reinvent the wheel.    thanks in advance.  
 i am trying to make an svg image that is drawn on a canvas appear transparent when the user touches it. i have tried adding an alpha value to the rgb color such that ff0000 (rgb red) becomes 1aff0000 (argb red but only 10% opaque) but it appears to ignore this completely.     this works as expected for rectangle shapes that are drawn directly to the canvas - any suggestions as to how this can be accomplished for svgs?    thanks guys!

 i am trying to access hbase from an ejb application for a poc.    following code snippet is written in ds layer :-         when i tried to debug the code i found  an exception is thrown at line         which says:-         my current set up is like i'm trying to access a standalone configured hbase from my remote machine. and what i have found out that whenever you start a hbase in standalone mode it automatically starts a zookeeper and  zookeeper uses sasl as the default authentication mechanism.the default zookeeper server comes with kerberos (gssapi) and digest_md5 based authentication schemes; as sasl supports pluggable authentication schemes  the user can register a new authentication mechanism and use it for sasl authentication with zookeeper . this mechanism includes making configuration in jaas configuration file.    so what i am looking is for zookeeper's location in standalone hbase configuration mode and what configuration is be to written in it. preferably if anyone could list out the steps that will be highly appreciable.

 i have asked questions whose answers often faced me in the direction of efficiency. rather than continuing asking these type of questions i would rather look beforehand at the efficiency. however there are of course many different types of efficiency. the number of lines in code  assembly  the time it takes to write  the time it takes for a computer to execute. and i probably miss a lot more ways to look at it.    because there are so many ways to look at efficiency  i would like to start with  how do you get the assembly code of your own code and stop at the right spot within your code?  (let's say you have 500 lines of code and you're interested in line 450 to 460). i am not sure if this is already a feature found in ides  if so how could i find functions like these? (= what is the naming of these sort of things so that i can find it for my own ides if it has this feature).    (there is already a lot of information about efficiency at stack overflow  i looked at many of them  however i found it hard to get a feel of what people often start with when they analyse their code. do they start with studying their code  then assembly or do they just use an ide to find the most expensive methods and change them this way? this is a bad question because it of course depends on a lot on different factors  but i hope to get at least a little bit more feel for it and i think an answer to this question might help.)   
 i have a problem.    i am trying to make a program where a user will type in     r=row c=column and after that 0's and 1's as long as the matric is full    so it will create a picture .... r*v ....  filled with char's 1's and 0's.    those 1's represent blocks. ow the program should output how many blocks are in that picture? (00010011110 - example for the first row of random matrix)- that would print out 2    i am struggling to correctly do the input of that program and after that count the number of those blocks.    this is what i had been trying so far.       
 in my application i have tokens. these tokens are always enclosed in [ ].   a token has an internal and an external representation  e.g. a variables internal representation: [x] and the external representation: [var=x].     i need to check strings for tokens a lot so i guessed it would be really helpful to have some kind of method that returns an array of tokens that are in this string.     to do this i thought about two approaches:       have an interface or abstract class token and build subclasses for each token. the benefits would be to be able to implement methods like getinternalrepresentation() and getexternalrepresentation() for each different token.  the downside is: as different tokens can appear in the same string and not every time every token should be processed id need to call instanceof a lot to check whether the token is one i want to process at that point or not.    i create an enum tokentype and a class token which has this tokentype. token contains the methods getinternalrepresentation() and getexternalrepresentation()  these return strings based on the tokentype.   the benefit is that i dont have to call instanceof as i can just check for the tokentype.   the downside is that i have two big methods that need to process every type of the enum and need to be adjusted  each time the enum gets adjusted. (which could be the case as new tokens could arise)      i also thought about combining the two approaches so that i have an abstract class token with a final tokentype field that gets set inside of the constructor. then i could use polymorphism for getinternalrepresentation() and getexternalrepresentation() and ask for the type of the token via the tokentype field. which of the approaches is the best? or am i missing out something?   
 i am currently trying to develop a plugin using the bukkit api in eclipse. however  it seems i cannot import specific classes from the api jar file. if i open the jar file up and look in the list of classes  the classes are there. however  eclipse will not accept import of those classes into my own classes. it shows an error denoting:        [classname] cannot be resolved to a type      i see no reason why the class should not be accepted. other classes from the same package are imported properly. other developers using the bukkit api do not have this problem (i specifically asked).    picture showing error:         the class   is in the same package as the class  . but   is properly imported    is not.     here's a picture showing what happens if i click the  fix project setup  option:         i have already tried to manually edit the build path.    picture showing proof that the class is really added to the build path of the project:          why would this happen  and how can i fix it?     i am using the 1.8 version of the api found at spigotmc.org. i am using the newest eclipse available from the linux mint repository (eclipse 3.8). this same error occurs in netbeans 8  however.  
 i have a question regarding selenium web driver. i want to test my web application using selenium. i write the test class in test folder of my maven project. once i give maven build command  the test classes are run and after successful run of test classes the build will be successful and i can deploy my app in web-apps folder of my apache-tomcat. but to run the test in selenium i need to have my app already running in my localhost. how will this happen ?? or is there something wrong with my approach??

 spring has transaction synchronizer that eats runtime exception here are spring code that does this -         is there a way through which i know about exception thrown while aftercomplete? i have considered solutions like thread locals but does spring provides a clean way of handling this? any one?    edit    the postcompletion method checks if rollback triggered and does some clean up. if clean up fails with an exception like connection reset or network issue  i wanted to add retry mechanism in my code. since postcompletion is called by third party code it throws an exception rollbackfailed. i want to catch that exception and add retry few more times as release resource is important for me. reference to spring jira issue -  https://jira.spring.io/browse/spr-12560

 i setup a selenium grid and added a chrome  an ie and two firefox (esr and current). it seems to me that setup and the calling code is correct  but the grid/node ignores my browser version for firefox.    i setup two browsers in one node:         they show up as version 31 and 34 in the grid.    the node logs says they were added:         when calling the grid with version 31 and 34 both requests are referred to the version 34 instance.    from the grid log:         the calling code is:         i left out the chrome and ie configuration. if i call them  they are just triggered fine  but i don't have a version there.  
 in order to write the minimum amount of code required  i'm trying to let modelmapper generate its implicit mapping and only write explicit property mappings for those properties that it couldn't auto-map.    if i let modelmapper generate an implicit mapping using:         it complains about   having multiple possible mappings. i then tried to fix just that using:         however  i found that modelmapper still complains  because an exception is actually thrown on    so it doesn't have a chance to reach my custom mapping code.     if i invert both statements  i get an error:        java.lang.illegalstateexception: a typemap already exists for class sourcetype and class desttype      if i leave out   completely  modelmapper complains about missing mappings for all other properties of the   (those who it was able to map automatically with  ).    i found no explicit clue in the documentation whether mixing implicit with explicit mappings is supported and how it's done.    can anyone help?  
 i am trying to build a project in eclipse and then start working on it. i have pulled it from my companies git hub repo and then imported into eclipse via maven.    when i do mvn clean install in the command line  it all succeeds and all the tests pass. in eclipse however  when i run the junit tests  some fail and i get errors. my boss says he thinks that eclipse is not configured correctly. how can i ensure that the eclipse is pointing at maven correctly? and that everything is inline and working as it should? i am working on eclipse kepler and really need to solve this soon.

 scenario: a statefuljob a is scheduled to run every 5 minutes on quartz. a0 is started at time t0; t0 = 10 minutes.    in the meanwhile  quartz try to start a1  but it can't beacause a0 is running.    a0 completed  at time t1 (10 minutes after the start). in this case  quartz will start delayed a1 job or the new a2?    in this case we can configure quartz to skip overlapped job istead of delay them?  
 i have some problem with glassfish certificate.    i have two environment here  let's say environment a and environment b. i deploy same application in that two environment. but when i try to run the application with latest version of chrome and firefox  i cant't open my application in environment b. but  i able to run the application in environment a  with same application.     i had try to copy the glassfish from environment b to environment a  i able to run the application within the glassfish that i had copy from environment b in environment a  otherwise  i can't run the application within the glassfish that i had copy from environment a to environment b.    i wonder how to solve this problem. did glassfish certificate had some effect for this problem?    maybe someone can help me to solve this problem. thanks before   
 jaxb has generated a class with a setter method that takes an abstract class as its parameter:         i understand that i cannot instantiate abstract classes  so in order to create an   object to pass to the method  i've created an anonymous subclass of   (which at the same time instantiates it). this works and gives me expected results. however  to create the anonymous subclass  i've hard coded the name of the abstract class:         i now need to make this dynamic as the name of the class   will be passed in as a parameter. i started to use reflection for this:         i now need to create an anonymous class from this but can't see how i can. the best i can see is:          this will obviously fail as you can't create an instance of an abstract class. i saw  is it possible to create an anonymous class while using reflection?  and if i understand correctly  it sounds like i can't use reflection with anonymous classes. can anyone add more advice - is there another way round this especially in the context of jaxb?  
 i am developing some little maven plugin and i need to edit some css and js files from target (not from src!). and i can't understand on what phase i can do it.     to get access to src i use the   and the following code:         how can i get target when all js css files are copied there but war file is not generated in order to edit some files from target and get final war with some modifications of js and css files?     edit   what for i need it. i have js files in my project: a.js  b.js. i want to obfuscate them via maven. i mean  obfuscate when i build project. and of course all files in final war must be obfuscated but the same files in src must be left unobfuscated. besides  i need to combine some obfuscated files into one file.

 in one process  in server side with java  i've to create a sqlite database and import a big amount of data (1.200.000 rows divided in 3 tables) and let the user download the generated database.        my first approach was to create the sqlite database in memory  execute all the inserts and finally save the database to disk. it works  but it is really slow. it takes up to 42 seconds.     the first improvement was to define one transaction. if i don't define the transaction  sqlite creates one for each insert  and this is slow. doing only one transaction for all of them  it takes around 30 seconds. this is not enough for our case.     a third approach  was to do the same but instead of executing each insert one by one calling executeupdate  create a stringbuffer with all the inserts and send them all together using only one call to executeupdate. this is slightly faster  but only 2 or 3 seconds.       when i though that there wasn't any way to do it faster  i realized that with the sqlite command line tool  i can execute \".import csv_file tablename\" and it imports the data much faster  so i can export my data to csv files and then import them with that tool. however  i would prefer to do not have to call any command line tool from the java code but i've not found any way to execute the same import using the jdbc driver. so my questions are:       do you know any way to do the same csv import that the command line tool does from java code?     do you have a better approach to create a sqlite database and import a big amount of data in an efficient way?        edit: the code &amp; sqlite schema:     i can't show the full schema definition but there are 3 tables created as follows:         there isn't any foreign key between the tables and there isn't any index apart than the pks.    regarding the code  it is simple. i generate all the inserts in a stringbuffer and finally i execute:         i'm currently using the xerial sqlite jdbc driver.

 i'm working with a distributed publish/subscribe system for the iot(it is a loosely coupled component infrastructure)  made in java and i have made some changes to it. specifically  i've implemented multicasting instead of unicasting. i'm interested in the impact and significance of these changes.    hence  i want to evaluate/benchmark my changes and i'm looking for advice since i'm completely new to this. what should or can i evaluate or profile as compared to the basic program? it is in the context of the iot. and  specifically  how can i do this? i'm working on ubuntu and use eclipse but no immediate tools jump out.    my ideas were as follows: i'd like to know how much the footprint of the program has changed in terms of deployment  so a measurement of the lines of code might be in order and the total size of the program. any tools for that? i'd also like to measure other stuff such as memory usage  cpu usage  ... anything that might be relevant.     in addition  but less relevant for this board  i'd like to measure network impact. i'm thinking of using wireshark and just capturing the traffic of the two versions of the java program. any additional suggestions? it seems a bit redundant since multicasting (in the link-local sense) just has 1/nth amount of packets compared to unicasting so i'm fairly limited. other things of note that i could/should measure?

 i searched for some answers on stackoverflow and atlassian but so far didnt find anything useful for me. maybe i'm just asking the wrong questions  but here my situation:    currently i am writing a jira tabpanel plugin  where data of an issue is displayed in the tabpanel. so far everything works fine. i now want to link from the html (or javascript) of my tabpanel back to my plugin to call an export function  that can save the data in specific formats.     i have no idea how i can do this. my first guesses were that there is a button you can create from the java jira code with a linked actionlistener or some javascript that calls the functions for you. but i have not found anything useful for me so far.     can anyone give me some information if and how you can do this and maybe some example? i am very thankful in advance.    regards chris  
 i have a js based web application developed using kendo ui framework.(jquery)    our server side is java and we would like to know how set access based controls user roles to ui components?    e.g. user a having admin roles would be able to see all components in a page where as user b who is not having admin roles wouldn't be able to see all components in the page.    so what is the best way to implement access control to components.  
 i believe i already know the problem but i'm not 100% so i just want someone to put my mind at ease. i'm using the sample code supplied by paypal for their express check but every time i run the code it makes it to the line   but i always get a   obviously this isn't the most informative error message however i have found a few questions/answers that could indicate that my firewall is blocking the web address (  or  ) or it is blocking the port  . so all i really want to know is am i correct in thinking that this error is being caused because of a firewall issue? if so what can i do to resolve this?    here is the part of the sample code that is making the call.         here's the error that appears in the console. i've also ran in tcp/ip monitor and i can see that the request is sent however it returns  .          edit     i have just been speaking to another developer and he has had the theory that it could possibly be our proxy that is stopping it connecting. i am now investigating this as well.  
 i am absolutly new in liferay portlet development and i have some problem to create an \"hello world\" test portlet into a project on which i am working on.    in this project it is used structs 2 to do the dispatchment.    so i have done the following operations:    1) i create the  testportlet1action  class into this folder:  /web/src/main/java/mypackage/actions/  where i define the  starttestportlet1()  method that is the starting method of my protlet (i think that this is the portlet entry point):         where  kmaction  provde me this  action  interface:    package com.opensymphony.xwork2;         so the  return success  statment return the  success  string.    2) then i have create a  jsp view  for this portlet named  testportlet1.jsp  (into thi folder  :  /web/src/main/webapp/testportlet1/testportlet1.jsp ):         3) so now i know that i have to update the  struts.xml  file (that it is into  web/main/resources  folder) that contains something like:         as you can see i have included the struts configuration file related to my hello world portlet  this one:         4) so now i have configured the  testportlet1-struts.xml  file  in this way:         5) now my problem is to understand how correctly configure the  web.xml  file (that i have into the folder **\\web\\src\\main\\webapp\\web-inf**). from what i understand in this file i have the mapping with the struts 2 servlets (or am i wrong?)    so i have something like this (for another working servlet):         so the first section definied the servlet and the second section definied the url pattern mapped to be handled by this servlet. is it true or am i missing something?    so what have i to do to configure my previous \"hello world test\" servlet? is this ok?         is this ok or am i missing something?    6) then i have to configure the  portlet.xml  file into the folder **\\web\\src\\main\\webapp\\web-inf**  adding:          where  starttestportlet1  represent the method  starttestportlet1()  definied in my action class.    7) then i add this statment into the  liferay-portlet.xml  configuration file:         8) finally i configured the file  liferay-display.cml  to set the categories of my portlet  something like this:         the problem is that when i try to add my portlet on the homepage of the portal i obtain this contet instead the expected hello world output:         testportlet1 is temporarily unavailable.

 i am new at the android programming. i want to build an app which can communicates to an arduino via bluetooth.    i started already and i have one activity where i can set up the connection und uphold it. it works pretty fine. for the connect and connected thread i wrote an own class which is called via an instanced verision in my activity.    but now comes the problem: after i have successfully connected to my arduino the current activity (connecting) should stop and open a new activity where i can start sending messages.  but how can i send / receive data from the thread i created in the previous activity?    i read something about service etc.? what is the best way to solve this?    when i have finished the app it should have many activities where i can communicate different data via bluetooth. therefore i want the first activity to set up the connection and then i can use it from the others.    public class bluetooth  {         looking forward for your help!

 i'm trying to got these sql-statement to a querydsl call.         can anyone give me a hint or a solution?    here is my domain (extract):         hope this helps a little bit more. i think the main point is that it's not possible to access join-tables with querydsl.  
 there are lots of questions about this topic on stackoverflow  but i do not seem to find one related to my problem.    i have an android application that needs to communicate with https servers: some signed with a ca registered in the android system keystore (common https websites)  and some signed with a ca i own but not in the android system keystore (a server with an autosigned certificate for instance).    i know how to add my ca programmatically and force every https connection to use it. i use the following code:         however  doing that disables the use of the android system keystore  and i cannot query https sites signed with other ca any more.    i tried to add my ca in the android keystore  using:         ... but i cannot then add my ca in it (an exception is launched).    i could use the instance method   instead of the static global   to tell on a case by case basis when my ca has to be used.    but it isn't practical at all  all the more since sometimes i cannot pass a preconfigured   object to some libraries.    some ideas about how i could do that?        edit - answer     ok  following the given advice  here is my working code. it might need some enhancements  but it seems to work as a starting point.       
 i have a service  that computes a collection every hour. in most cases the computed collection will be the same as the current persisted one. therefore i want to generate a checksum of the collection to verify  if i have to update the persistent one. i found  this entry  in the glossary  where there is a checksum function  but can't find how to use it.

 i'm having a problem using flashattributes behind a reverse proxy. my configuration is a jboss behind an apache (using mod_proxy).     i use a post-redirect-get philosophy basing on the flashattributes to pass info to the get. without the apache (accessing the jboss directly) everything works flawlessly  but with the apache on the flashmaps arrive null to the get.     i googled for this problem and i found some questions regarding balanced architectures (not my problem) and another  question  talking about my exact problem  but there was no solution posted.     did somebody found a solution for this? it can be a configuration of apache or something that can be done with spring. i really would like to avoid returning to the pre 3.1 way (using manually the session to store the attributes for the get).     the curious thing is that in the spring documentation there is not even a hint about this problem with the flashattributes  and i can not imagine that they did not know about this problem.    thanks in advance  
 we have a large (old) java servlet project that is still compiled for java 1.3  we run this code only in our own server with a modern jre.    what is the downside of compiling classes for 1.3 instead of targeting to latest modern 1.8?  are there any risks  if we start to compile code for 1.8?  
 i tried finding the question  but yet not found any link for this answer.    the issue we are facing is          this issue seems to be not able to load xercesimpl.jar or at least not able to find the file. xercesimpl.jar is already present in /web-inf/lib  but it is not able to locate it on tomcat 7.    on tomcat 8  this works fine. any pointers to what can be done or where the probable issue lies  other than moving the lib in tomcat's lib folder.    thanks    amit

 i am working with some code where i want to change the background image dynamically while referencing the shared preferences. an example of an activity i have is this:         the managepreferences class looks like this:         the problem is  the code for setting the background is not working from a different class. i can get the code to work if i copy it into the splash activity  but not if i reference the class and call the method; i would prefer to not clutter my code.    all i am trying to do is change the layout (setbackgrounddrawable) in the splash activity by making a call to this managepreferences class.     thanks all!  
 lets say for example i have the following query (simple one but i know we use native sql queries only when we have complex ones which cannot be written as named queries)         now i was told that we are supposed to write these native sql queries in somefile.hbm.xml file rather than the way i have written in a java file. why is that?  
 i'm using   and      the invoke method in the cardproducer.jsp file:         the controller:         after delete it should list all cardproducers:         the log info show the request url is cardpro as follow:         the right things is delete cardproducer then show all of them. it causes an infinite loop.

 i have a question about hibernate constrains  about one issue that i never had before. imagine that i have a table(snapshot) where i can add some snapshot rows  which every single one have to be related with just one row of another tables. but this relationship is not only with one table  multiple tables can join with this snapshot table. but i want to prevent that once one row of snapshot is already link with another row table lets say:         its not possible that another table pick up the same row for his relationship          because if dont  imagine the issue when im trying to do a delete on cascade on a.    any idea how to make this work with hibernate unique constraints

 i'm currently writing an android app in which in one fragment  the user enters in a time that they start their morning commute at  via the timepicker contained in a dialogfragment. that gets input into a gregoriancalendar object. when i check the object's tostring method in both fragments  the settings i choose are in there  both the hour  minutes  and am/pm value. my problem comes that when i call the appropriate textview's set text method  the hour always defaults to 12 every single time  even though in the gregoriancalendar object's tostring method  all the values have been passed successfully. for some reason i keep losing specifically the hour when i call gettime(). i'm an entry-level coder  so i'm sure there's something i'm missing but i haven't been able to find the answer in the apis. i thought maybe gettime() returns default values  but then why the minutes are intact?    the point of this method is to update the mdisplayworkcommute textview when its settext() is called after receiving an extra  and that's where i'm seeing that the text keeps getting a default hour (12)  but still displaying the minute value that was set. i've narrowed it down to something i'm doing wrong here  but there's always the possibility that the issue is somewhere else. any help would be greatly appreciated.         edit:      is being cast to   because passing a string to the  's   seemed to cause eclipse to keep telling me that i was passing an invalid argument. i just tried it again and it compiled fine and eclipse didn't panic this time  so that's struck out. mdrivetoworktime is a gregoriancalendar object that i'm using  and the data that's currently stored in it by the time it's passed to the fragment this is happening in is  according to its          java.util.gregoriancalendar[time=? arefieldsset=false lenient=true zone=america/new_york firstdayofweek=1 minimaldaysinfirstweek=1 era=? year=1 month=1 week_of_year=? week_of_month=? day_of_month=1 day_of_year=? day_of_week=? day_of_week_in_month=? am_pm=0 hour=? hour_of_day=9 minute=45 second=1 millisecond=? zone_offset=? dst_offset=?]      the   object that gets created returns         tue feb 01 00:45:01 est 1      as its  . the hour is getting reset to a default every time  but the minute stays intact. this is the xml for mdisplayworkcommute (it's setting in a  ):       
 i have 4 java processes running in parallel  and each of them updates the db. my app gets closed after mongodb is closed. i get the following error -        caused by:   org.springframework.scheduling.quartz.jobmethodinvocationfailedexception:   invocation of method 'someprocess' on target class [class someclass]   failed; nested exception is java.lang.illegalstateexception: this   mongo has been closed      i think the problem is that all the processes are accessing the same mongodb instance  and when one of them updates the db  it closes the instance  which other processes are trying to access  and thus the app throws an error and is closed. the app was running fine earlier  before breaking one single process into 4 processes (essential requirement).    i want to ask whether 1) if anybody has faced the same issue before  what might be the problem)? and 2) if the above mention issue is the problem  how do i solve it?  
 i am coming from java but have been doing some node.js lately  and have been looking at the eventemitter module in node.    what i don't understand is the fundamental difference between event-driven programming and 'regular' programming.    here is some psuedo-code to demonstrate my idea of \"event-driven\" programming.         the only work the eventemitter object seems to be doing is creating a hash relationship between the string representation of an event (in this case 'grovel') and a function to respond with. seems like that's it  not much magic there.    however  my question is - how does event-driven programming really work behind the scenes with low-level events like mouse-clicks and typing? in other words  how do we take a click and turn it into a string (like 'grovel') in our program?

 i am working an application which is using jpa and hibernate.    but in my dao(data access objects) layer  i see the simple code to get the entitymanager object. that is         i am not interacting anything with entity manager factory.     why can an entitymanager be created without any default/implemented entity manager factory?     my code doesn't specify any entitymanagerfactory in any configuration (spring  jpa) or code.    does hibernate create entitymanger objects using default entitymanagerfactory objects?  or can hibernate directly create entitymanager objects without needing a factory object?  
 i created a plugin which queries the selected project name &amp; path and displays it in a view at the startup. here is my code on how i am querying for the selected project:          if project been changed (user selects any other project) or if the selected project been closed  how could i get a notification ?  
 i have the following code in java:         sample output:         i copied the base64 output into a file (test-in)  and tried decrypting it using the following command:         i got a   error message (exit code: 1). trying different modes (id-aes192-gcm and id-aes256-gcm) resulted the same.    what i'm doing wrong?  
 though this question might be asked several time on so(mostly in form of   vs  s in synchronized block)  but i am not clear about the synchronization on static reference/object of a class(3rd example) of this question. please have a look on below java examples:        example#1  -   block with   keyword    public class bar implements runnable {         }        result  :  while any thread from   acquire lock through synchronized block(say   acquire)  then   and   would be in  blocked  state  but at the same time other threads     and   are allowed to perform  concurrently .         example#2  -   block with      public class bar implements runnable {             result  :  only one thread of any instance of   class  will acquire lock(say   acquire lock) and all other thread( ) will be blocked till   releases the lock.        example#3  -   block with    reference / object       public class bar implements runnable {         }     question  :        what would be the effect of using   reference/object in   block (as in  example#3 )     what would be the effect of using  non-static  reference/object in    block.     also does the static reference   in synchronized block ( ) is equivalent to   ?     
 i have tried to find tutorials about encryption based purely on own developed code.    for example in java you have the javax.crypto package  in c# you have the windows.security.cryptography dll. however i am trying to find a tutorial how to encrypt data with bits/bytes without using predefined classes/dll.    does anyone know where and if there are such tutorials?

 what i miss the most in intellij compared to eclipse is the test run history window. does anything like this exist in intellij? i didn't find it anywhere so far and have looked a few times at least.    in our project we have ~500 integration test cases which take like 5 minutes to run from ide. often i have a situation where for e.g. 5 tests fail in 2-3 different classes. i fix something  that should remove failures from first test suite  rerun it to see if it helped and i must rerun all 500 tests to see which classes contained failures earlier. that is really painful. in eclipse i would just lookup those in test history  repair them also and finally run all 500 to check if nothing new camed up.    is there a plugin out there or do i miss something obvious?    i use intellij 13.

 in my database i have a table (keyframe) which has several columns. besides some general information about the keyframe  i have a column to identify to which video the keyframe belongs (videoid). also i have a column to store the information at which time the keyframe is shown in the video e.g. the keyframe is at second 2 in the video (timecode).    now another application sends me a list of strings in the form \"12345#123\" where the first number is the videoid and the second number the timecode. this list can have several thousand entries.    now imagine i get the following list:         what i currently do is  i create a huge sql which looks something like the following:         as you can imagine  with several thousand entries  especially when the videoid is different  the sql grows in size. however  thats not a big deal for the database. executing the statement directly on the database only takes some milliseconds. but since i use hibernate to get my entities  this takes a while. the main problem is the following line. with 22k entries in the list it takes more than 30 seconds to load all the entities  which is not acceptable because the other appliation will time out.          my question is : how could i possibly speed up my application? is there any common name for this kind of problem and if so  whats the best practice?    thank you in advance jan    ps: unfortunately i cannot use some kind of paging functionality in the webservice call.

 my primary need is to get dau  mau  crash percent  availability  rating etc.  for any custom time period. (eg: last 2days  1week  date1 - date2 etc. ) so far i have been using the data from crash trends page in dashboard  by setting custom date values and getting the data/values manually.    so  i wanted to automate this  and started implementing the rest api. the documentation seemed pretty vague  and i only found the endpoint \"apps\" in the api to be returning something related to what i am looking for (but it only provides very limited details  and no way to set custom dates)  api i request used :   https://developers.crittercism.com:443/v1.0/apps?attributes=appname crashpercent mau rating     am i missing something in the documentations??    can someone tell me how i can get the details i want from via the rest api??    mainly the crash trends details like availability/crash percent/dau/mau etc.  for custom date intervals (not exceeding more than a month). thanks!

 currently i am facing application (java rmi based) hang situation and rmi client gui become black. in the application log does not record any exception and client / server communication has completely stopped at one stage. once user restart the application it will resume the operations.    initially we thought it was due to a jvm issue since we saw a dump file during this hang situation. this dump file was not able to open or copy during this time  it is disappearing once we closed the application. we re-installed the jvm but this issue still hits intermittently.    we noticed this issue started few months after the production cutover and we did not come across during our testing and the initial few months of live cutover.    application background    -rmi client/server based compiled on java 1.7_55 -os (client win7 32 bit &amp; server win 2008 32 bit data centre)  win2008 runs on vmware -db mssql server 2008    it would be great if someone can advice me on this.    thanks and regards    chamantha

    i want to use  micro service  for document upload &amp; download module of  dms (document management system).      is there any  performance  impact to use upload &amp; download module as micro service with compare to use as that module as  embedded  code in  dms ?     this micro service is only responsible to store and retrieve data from different document repositories and using apache  commons vfs2 api  to read &amp; write document data (i.e. any io operations) to and from different repositories.     is there any  performance  impact of commons  vfs2 api  to read &amp; write document data (i.e. any io operations) to different repositories?      
 i read a csv file with university courses (11000 rows) and want to insert this using hibernate into a mysql database. the problem is that hibernate inserts each row twice. there is a bug regarding this issue. solution should be to flush each child after persisting. see here:  hibernate inserts duplicates into a @onetomany collection  and  https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/hhh-6776  here is the code from my spring applications controller:         even though i flush after each   double rows gets inserted. i have the   annotation on the controller class  is this the reason flush doesn't solve the problem? it however seems much slower when having   there  which seems like it runs correctly compared to when it does a bulk insert on the end without flushing each insert.    someone have a clue what is wrong in my code?     thank you!     edit:     added university and course entities:    course:         and university:

 you can copy paste the below example to run on your local machine. i am learning multithreading and i came across this example online. i am confused as to why the method add(inside class counter) would make a difference if declared synchronized  you can remove the keyword synchronized from it and it would not affect the end result so i am just wondering what's the purpose to be served by declaring it synchronized       
 i am facing an issue with form builder while it is accessed by more than one user at a time. there is no issue if only one member accesses it. i am getting the following error dialogue often.      ?    the following is the tomcat console output. i am using tomcat 6.0.37.         i have explored the  http://wiki.orbeon.com/forms/doc/developer-guide/context-and-session-listeners  page. it says that \"the orbeon forms servlet context listener allows configuring one processor to be called when the servlet context is initialized  and one to be called when the servlet context is destroyed.\" we are using orbeon 4.5.30 community edition. is it an issue with community edition or will it occur in professional edition too? please guide me on this to configure the form builder to be accessed by multiple user at time.

 i'm trying to check to see if a triangle is a right triangle in java. this is a portion of what the tester class does:         a portion of my triangle class receives the values and sets them to x1 y2 etc:         the first two segments of code were given to me. i am to make the last segment of code which i made to be this:         however  it still returns false. what am i doing wrong? thanks a bunch!    update: thanks for the help. i seem to have made a rather noob-ish mistake. i never thought about the fact that doubles weren't really accurate (sorry  just trying to say what i did in simple terms). i ended up inputting this:         once again  thanks for the help!  
 i am developing an android app that allows the user to save their data (input and output) to a file  say on an external sd card.  rather than use multiple 'save' buttons  it would be nice if this can be done automatically with a checkbox 'tick' and the user notified of successful data saved to a file via a toast. the user can choose when to save their data. the code (with suitable xml files) compiles to an apk package  but the program crashes on a real device.     also  it seems that in a simpler version with only one add method  the checkbox would only allow one input/output entry  not repeated entries as desired if ticked.     i wonder whether the statement   needs to be declared as a class statement? thanks for any help with all this!         changes made accordingly. thanks for the tips.  in response  here is the logcat output on the device emulator after entering a number in the application  checkbox tick and clicking the gui button (the application crashes):

 this is related to this question:  java 8 function composition     i noticed that a method reference can be assigned to a variable declared as    and so i assume it should have   or   function  and hence i expect that we can compose them directly. but apparently we need to assign them to a variable declared as   first (or type-cast before invocation) before we can call   or   on them.    i suspect i might have some misconception about how this should work.    so my questions:      why do we need to type-cast or assign it to a variable first before we can call the   method?   what exactly is the type of method reference that it needs to be done in this way?      sample code below.                more description on the error    in eclipse it's highlighted with the error message:        the target type of this expression must be a functional interface           and in java 8 compiler the error is:     java8test.java:14: error: method reference not expected here         int twelve = methods.operate(1  (mymethods::triple).andthen(mymethods::quadruple));                                          ^ 1 error     (actually  why the error in eclipse is different from the one from java 8 compiler?)  
  here is the challenge that i face:        i have a third party webapp that does not use spring.   i don't have access to their code.    i have access to their    so i added the below          in my custom code  i want to use spring autowired components          however my guess is they are internally using   when they initialize this class  thus 'service' param is not injected.        question:  -  what options do i have in designing testaction  such that  even if they use new testaction() the dependency components will be injected?     i thought about initializing an application context in the default constructor of `testaction()`` but that does not feel like a right solution. are there other elegant solutions?    i do see from the logs that the spring files are being  loaded and injected  (after i changed the  )

 java 8.  eclipse luna.  i am having bizarre trouble assigning a final variable accessed by an anonymous method body.     the background     i am validating a namespace-less xml file with my own choice of xsd schema. the file has no   declaration  but the schema has a   declaration. obviously  the file will fail validation. to make it pass validation regardless  i give a filter to the validator to force it to pretend the xml file has    as suggested  here . see the code below.     the problem     notice the variable  . if i initialize it with a string literal namespace  validation passes. if i initialize with a method call that returns the  same value   validation fails.     the code           the error         cvc-complex-type.2.4.a: invalid content was found starting with element 'childtag'. one of '{\"mynamespace\":childtag}' is expected.      it gets more bizarre.  validation passes when the method returns   as a string literal.  but validation fails when the method obtains the value of   from the xsd file.  i have verified with   that the value passed to   when validation fails is indeed  exactly the same  as when validation passes!    the only difference i can see here is that it passes when the value assigned to the final variable   is ultimately  a constant  (the string literal)  and it fails when the value assigned is ultimately  determined by some condition  (derived from the xsd file). final or effectively final makes no difference.    is this a known java bug?  or is it my lack of understanding of initialization of variables accessed from anonymous methods?  does the xsd validation really have anything to do with it?  
 in c++  the file of the source code and current line number is decided by  file  and  inline   which is decided at compiling time  is there any method in java that could do the similar thing?  the file and line number is decided at compiling time instead of runtime?  this will be convenient for log.  i kind of doubt that use runtime method to detect these information will decrease the performance.  
 i need to represent both very large and small numbers in the shortest string possible. the numbers are unsigned. i have tried just straight base64 encode  but for some smaller numbers  the encoded string is longer than just storing the number as a string. what would be the best way to most optimally store a very large or short number in the shortest string possible with it being url safe?

 scala's collection provides a method called   that merges   and   into a single method. it's particularly useful when filtering an   collection to produce a subset of that collection containing only a particular type.    is there any such thing with java 8's stream?  
 i have an app that utilizes gcm to get push notifications. i am getting the overall bandwidth used by the app using the following code.         then i have a runnable which constantly updates the usage.         the problem is that the number bytes is always 0. this causes me to believe that since i am using gcm  it does not show up as bandwidth used by my application. how else can i get this information?

 i'm really flummoxed by this one. after having some problems managing separate hashmaps for each child class  i decided to try using instanceof to make things simpler with a hashmap of the parent class that will include any number of each of the child classes. i came up with this test code:         i put the loop counter in there to see if the for loop was doubling up somehow but the output is:          i see the parent class (labeled scout here) executes once correctly. the constructor class in ant assigns an id based on the number of ants  so the forager should be forager2  soldier should be soldier3  etc.    i cannot for the life of me figure out why the child classes are executing twice. the loop counter shows this.     does anyone have any suggestions?    edit: you can see i tried a couple different things within the for loop to get the expected results.)    (i did try to tag this as homework  although this is not a specific solution.)

 i need to put my java information in a string so i use the   constructor. ow this information is sent to the c program as a   type. now i need to get back original bytes since  from my understanding  they were encoded in the process of creating a java  .    how can i do that in the c program?    so  on the c side i have these bytes:         they are in a   but the reach java as a string and the string is:         as you can see there many similarities...  
 how would jestresult.getsourceasobjectlist be used to map the field \"@timestamp\"?  actually  i cannot figure out how to map any field with a name starting with \"@\".  it keeps getting set to \"null\".     for example if the elasticsearch query returns         and there is a matching pojo java class         then doing         prints out         so the \"@version\" and \"@timestamp\" are not getting mapped properly.    jsonobject itself seems to be just fine with \"@\" symbols:         outputs: \"zzz\"    what is the proper usage of jestresult. getsourceasobjectlist to map a json field with a name starting with \"@\"?    note: this is for       
 i need to de-serialize the following file using jackson streaming api.         and then put them to a hashmap kvmap using kvmap.put(k  valueclass);  my understanding is that the way to do that is: i have to parse the string of k using jp.getcurrentname()  and then get valueclass using: mapper.readvalue(jp  valueclass.class). i.e.:         my understanding is that  the only way to deserialize key is jp.getcurrentname() because it is not included in {} as a json format so i cannot get it using such as readvalue(). is it correct? then  my question is how to implement a function to convert from string key to generic type k? i think if readvalue() can convert string to corresponding generic type  ideally  i should be able to convert a string key to a generic type k as well. but how?    
 i'm trying to get an array of objects to render into a gamescreen. i've looked around and found some similar questions asked by others  but i can't seem to apply the answers they've gotten to my program.    the problem seems to occur in the nested for-loops. in trying to solve this issue  i've gotten java nullpointerexceptions at the first line within those for loops.         the classes hero and spark are as follows:         and:         within the for loops  i've printed the values of sparkarray  so i think i have an issue with values rather than references from the other questions i've read the answers to. (here are the questions i (unsuccessfully) referenced:  java. array of objects     java nullpointerexception with objects in array )    thanks in advance!

 i have heard java 8 provides a lot of utilities regarding concurrent computing. therefore i am wondering what is the simplest way to parallelise the given for loop?       
 in my java code  i'm invoking z3 in a loop to check a formula (which depends on the loop index and is different for every iteration) until the formula becomes satisfiable  as sketched in the following pseudo code fragment:         however  i'm quickly running into memory issues (i.e.  a   with message \"out of memory\" is thrown)  and i feel that i'm probably not correctly disposing the created z3objects.    since i did not find information of this (i just found  z3 java api documentation or tutorial  and  performance issues about z3 for java )  my questions are:      when calling    are all contained   disposed as well or do i need to remember them somewhere and call   on any of them?   would it be more performant to move the creation and disposal of the context and solver out of the loop and instead use   and   inside the loop?   what other   should i dispose \"manually\" in the given case?

 i'm always assumed that if a statement was declared false  such as    then writing   would in turn reverse   to be true. yet  was this an entirely wrong misconception? for instance  in the code below;         is the second for loop searching for   to be true of false? because if it was implying that the divisor is false  wouldn't it just say :

 i am trying to add a set of data called    however when i click the add button it will give the following error (it give a lot of lines in the output but this is the first few lines):         when i click on the error it takes me to this line in the code:         this is the full code for this method which is called in the add button:         i used the system.out.println(); to test the results the deliverytoadd shows the consignmentnumber and the rest show as expected.    this is the start of this class where the deliveryrecord was declared:         this is the deliveryrecord class         any help would be appreciated  
 the idea is similar to dropbox. i need to write a simple program that has a repository folder(which acts as a server and lets call it a) and other folders which has to be synced with the repo(let's assume b c and d). if i create/update a file  file1  in folder a the file should be synced with all other folders b c  and d. and if i create a file  file2  in b  file2 also be synced with other folders.    i believe i should use observer pattern so that there will be listeners every time a file is updated. are there any helper java classes for file synchronization?     the main idea is i just want to practice  file syncing using java  for future projects that we might have to integrate and also apply the knowledge of multi threading and locks in this project.    i just need a guidance not a written code. i appreciate your help.  
 so i have this loop to basically go through and arraylist of string and then remove an element from it if found:         however  the method just compare to the first element in the list and if its not the right one just go in the else loop without checking the others.i dont know how to fix that.heres my arraylist if needed:         thank you.  
 hi i need help with a personal project. i'm developing a software to manage shows(event)  and i have problem to save and object into my arraylist inside class. i have 3 object  artist event  contract  every time user sign a contract between an artist and agent  i want to be able to save the artist  into the agentcontract inside the agent class. because i need a list of artist for each agent. my problem is every time i try to save than  my program save all  the artist in the first agent  only. can someone help me???    this is my artist class:         .....    .....            i'm using this method to sign the contract and save the artist into the artistlist of agent

 i have recently acquired a beacon from kontakt.io    i followed the \"monitoring code example\" from here:  http://docs.kontakt.io/android-sdk/quickstart/#monitoring-code-sample     the kontakt library is included (since other methods from the library is working)  but the following line is giving me an error:         error:         i have also tried creating a new region with the proximity uuid from the beacon:         but this throws the same error.    i'm quite new to java and this might be a fairly simple question  but how do i resolve this?  
 i'm trying to read in a .csv file containing node data (p-values mostly) into my progam  but in doing so i have to convert them from strings into doubles. here's the method for it:         the object node is parameterized as node(int  string  double)  but the first line of the file i'm trying to convert is a column name  and i'm not entirely sure of the nature of the entries after that. here's a look at the start of the file:        gene common gal1rgexp gal4rgexp gal80rexp gal1rgsig gal4rgsig gal80rsig   yhr051w cox6 -0.034 0.111 -0.304 3.75720e-01 1.56240e-02 7.91340e-06   yhr124w ndt80 -0.090 0.007 -0.348 2.71460e-01 9.64330e-01 3.44760e-01   ykl181w prs1 -0.167 -0.233 0.112 6.27120e-03 7.89400e-04 1.44060e-01   ygr072w upf3 0.245 -0.471 0.787 4.10450e-04 7.51780e-04 1.37130e-05   yhl020c opi1 0.174 -0.015 0.151 1.40160e-04 7.19120e-01 1.53950e-02   ygr145w ygr145w 0.387 -0.577 -0.088 5.37920e-03 8.27330e-03 7.64180e-01   ygl041c ygl041c 0.285 -0.086 0.103 4.46050e-04 4.50790e-01 7.03040e-01   ygr218w crm1 -0.018 -0.001 -0.018 6.13810e-01 9.79400e-01 8.09690e-01   yor202w his3 -0.432 -0.710 0.239 1.09790e-02 1.79790e-04 5.48950e-03   ycr005c cit2 0.085 0.392 0.464 4.18980e-02 1.53050e-06 2.74360e-06   yer187w khs1 0.159 0.139 -0.045 8.51260e-04 4.17830e-03 6.18020e-01   ybr026c ybr026c 0.276 0.189 0.291 3.63320e-05 6.15230e-04 1.24430e-03   ymr244w ymr244w 0.078 -0.239 -0.072 5.76050e-01 3.55240e-01 8.85690e-01   etc etc..      so the code creates nodes for each line based on the first and fifth columns  as well as a unique counter. however how can i skip the first line that just has the column names? i'm a little hesitant to simply have something skipping all first lines in all files  as not all files read may have a string as a first line. even then  are the following lines suitable for being converted to doubles?    thanks!  
 why did the java language designers use the term \"runtimeexception\"? isn't this bad terminology? i mean any exception will occur at runtime whether it's a checked exception (such as ioexception) or an unchecked exception.    wouldn't it have been better if they created checkedexception and uncheckedexception that both extend throwable?

 edit: fixed!  was overwriting file instead of appending to the file.    i seem to have a bit of a problem trying to use a printwriter to add a \"header\" to a log file before use  so that my program knows that it is not just a random text file.  the field output_file refers to an argument taken by the logger initialization function to set the log file  whereas log_file is a static file field for the (global and static) logging class.  after opening the log file to check for errors   there is no header.   using logging functions  also carried out by a printwriter  gives the correct output.  am i doing something wrong?  (i know i am reinventing the wheel as a logging api already exists for java  but i am working on a learning exercise.)         edit: the file is definitely writable  or the logger itself wouldn't work.  also  for those who were wondering  the code to log something is the following (same general method as writing the header aka new printwriter(log_file);)       
 i have a simple solution  but would like to find a more streamlined solution  if i were to update my database.    right now i am looking for ten floats  using this code i have no problem  these take the ten floats i have stored in my database.         what i would rather do  is take my database  and add the stored values to the array.     something along the lines of...         i am looking to basically end up with the same outcome as the first codeblock  but iterating through my datalist adding to the new float  allowing for future database additions  to take care of themselves.

 i am having an issue getting tess4j to work in a 32-bit jvm environment.  oddly  it works in 64bit  but not 32bit (opposite of the issue others seem to face).         i have created a lib folder in the root directory and placed the dll's in it.         i have also tried to place the dlls in the root directory  with no luck. i have attempted to run it from a 32bit ide with 32bit jvm  and still no luck.    i would just use the 64bit as is  but i require using another library that will only work in a 32bit environment.     i would appreciate any input on this.    thanks  
 i'm attempting to implement a function in my priority queue that will get the next item from the queue  and then restructure itself - replacing the previous 'root' node with the next lowest and then comparing that new 'root' node with it's children to see if it needs to be switched - and then repeat that for that nodes children.    so far i have the following code:         however i've hit a brick wall when trying to figure out how to code this for a list with a variable amount of calls to this function - as my code will crash once the queue reaches length 3...     i was just wondering if anyone can help me make this code stable and more usable than what i currently have.   
 i am trying to insert a series of values into a sql query using java's postgresql jdbc4.      specifies a method to convert   into  :      the only problem is  no matter what i try  it always returns null.           is retrieved through a working   via  .   works for all our other database uses  but its   method always returns null.    i have tried both upper case \"bigint\" and lower case \"bigint\" for typename  as per  this question   to no avail.    when i dig through the debugger  i find that   is a   wrapping a  .    if the feature wasn't supported by postgres/jdbc4  i would expect calling it to throw a sqlexception indicating it's unsupported. no exception is thrown.    any clue as to  why  it's returning null?    how can i fix it  or else  how can i pass in an array or list of values to a  ?

 i'am trying to create a tool for demonstrating graphs and algorithms. for that purpose i've found graphstream library. i have read all of its documentation and tutorials but i cant make this one thing work. i am trying to put graph into my custom gui (left menu with buttons and right graph space) and i managed to do that. now when i enabled two buttons: generate - creates graph with random generator  and clear - clears graph  it all works fine but after clear when i press generate  i get following error:        exception in thread \"thread-2\" org.miv.pherd.idalreadyinuseexception:   a particle with the same identifier already exists (0)      i dont understand why this is a problem because in my simple test program without gui  i made simple code in main to do the same thing and it works:         this code works but when i execute it within my gui with buttons i throws error which i have mentioned above. i also checked how many threads are running in my program and it seems 3 of them are. i hope my problem is pretty clear and someone can help me. thank you all!  
 gwt superdevmode is really handy. however the problem with this mode is that we cannot see the logs (and error stacktraces) like the standard gwt  the only logs i can see are the logs in the browser console which is not really much helpful when debugging in java.     is there a way to access the same logging with the standard gwt (or similar) with superdevmode?  
 i'm trying to use  jsch  to upload a file to a remote  sftp  share. every time i attempt to connect to the share from within my code  i get an exception that looks something like this:         i've seen  posts that describe this error  when upgrading to java 8  but we're still on java 7  and i don't know enough about java's cryptography support to know if that matters.    some people suggest installing jce (java cryptography extensions) to solve this problem  so i gave it a shot  but i still get the same error after copying the appropriate jar files into the /libs/security directory and restarting the application. we confirmed that jce was installed by executing  this script  and noting that the exception was not thrown.    i also tried connecting to the remote sftp share from the terminal using the   command in verbose mode. here's what i got:         if i'm reading the output correctly (and i may not be) the handshake process settled on using   for key exchange and   for the actual session encryption. according to  the jsch documentation  (minimal though it may be)  both of these algorithms are supported.    i can connect to this share with both the   command-line utility and with filezilla  so the problem has to either be with jsch or with my java configuration  but i'm at a loss to figure out what's what.    java version:         jsch version:         thanks in advance!     edit:  it looks like  a bug for this exact behaviour  was filed against the jdk  but was closed with no resolution. there's also  an email thread  between the maintainers of jsch and the jdk developers that discusses the issue  but has no resolution.

 i am trying to get the thread dump from a java service (call it a). the java service a is running under the virtual account. here are what i have tried in the cmd and the corresponding results.      jstack : access is denied.   jstack -f : error attaching to process: windbg error: waitforevent failed!   using psexec to run jstack: still can't access a because psexec only allows the service to run under local system account  but i need to run jstack under the virtual account so that it matches the account under which a is running   procdump: tools like these only give me stacktraces of jvm  not that of a.   sc: that tool allows me to run a service  but jstack is not a service.      so none of those worked. is there any other way i can get the thread dump?    thanks in advance  
 i'm using spring mvc with hibernate but i've reached a weird situation  when my service annotated with @transational finishes it's execution it seems that hibernate is executing an extra update in my entity  an update that is not coded anywhere. could someone help me? my controller:         my service: @service(\"userservice\") public class userserviceimpl implements userservice {         my dao:         console log shows this:    hibernate: select user0_.id as id8_  user0_.created as created8_  user0_.last_updated as last3_8_  user0_.email as email8_  user0_.email_confirmed_at as email5_8_  user0_.first_name as first6_8_  user0_.last_name as last7_8_  user0_.password as password8_ from users user0_ where user0_.id=?     hibernate: update users set created=?  last_updated=?  email=?  email_confirmed_at=?  first_name=?  last_name=?  password=? where id=?     hibernate: select user0_.id as id8_  user0_.created as created8_  user0_.last_updated as last3_8_  user0_.email as email8_  user0_.email_confirmed_at as email5_8_  user0_.first_name as first6_8_  user0_.last_name as last7_8_  user0_.password as password8_ from users user0_ where user0_.id=?    hibernate: update users set first_name=?  last_name=?  email=?  created=?  last_updated=?  email_confirmed_at=? where id=? why ?     hibernate: update users set created=?  last_updated=?  email=?  email_confirmed_at=?  first_name=?  last_name=?  password=? where id=?     i'm not understanding why is executing this two updates that are not coded anywhere. the problem is that i'm using md5 on postgres to encrypt the user's password  and i cannot let it update the password every time some other attribute gets updated  or else the password will be encrypted again  changing it  but right now those two updates not coded are setting the password in database without encrypting it to \"novo password\".    any help will be appreciated.

 it seems that an abstract class means the definition of the class is not complete and hence cannot be instantiated.    and i saw some simple java code which has an abstract class with all of the methods defined. then i was wondering  why do they make it as an abstract class instead of a real class? are they doing this so we cannot instantiate from this abstract class? or they are getting other benefits from making an abstract class with everything defined?

 we have a product  where  client  connects to  server .  client  is implemented in  c  and uses  openssl   while  server  is implemented using  java  code with  bufferedinputstream  and  bufferedoutputstream . the following are my observations:      application level data transfer is very slow  there is \"inordinate\" delay during connection establishment.   using  ssldump  it was found that ssl handshake response from  server  is taking most of the time. rest of the application data transfer and processing hardly takes fraction of a second. the response from ssl handshake by  server  comes after anywhere between 2 to 13 seconds after initial response sent by  client .   subsequent analysis of the code showed that it was the first buffered read/write which was taking \"inordinate\" amount of time.   understanding that first buffered read/write was hung on ssl connection completion  i introduced  sslconnect::starthandshake()  so that i can explicitly see where is the problem. it was observed that now  starthandshake()  blocked for as much time as first read/write did. further none of the read/write calls block  and returned data almost immediately.      i would like to understand why  starthandshake()  is taking so long. i understand that it is a asynchronous call  but still the time delay is too much imo. is it something to do with the socket configuration/cipher/encryption used? using  ssldump  i found there was absolutely no data transfer between the sending of client's hello request and subsequent response from server  so apparently all the time  starthandshake()  is busy doing something or may be nothing - what i have no idea. fwiw  this is not a network latency issue  1) all the boxes are on the same network  2) all other data transfers combined takes less than 0.4s.    can somebody kindly suggest what might be wrong or what can be done to fix this? could it be some socket or ssl setting  encryption/cipher used  or something else?

 so i've been following an oracle tutorial on javafx and i copied the code exactly. i even went as far as to copy paste it from the text version into my ide. i'm 100% sure that the code is correct.     the first one i followed was this video series.   the second tutorial i used to ensure that there were no errors in the code   and the text version i copied .    in my frustration i decided to go from my desktop to my laptop to work  so i uploaded the faulty code to my online repository and lo and behold!  it suddenly worked!  which indicates that i am right about there being no errors in the code. but as soon as i make any changes  it stops working again.    the error messages i receive indicates that it happens inside of the application i'm extending in my   where i have the  .    i'm using netbeans as my ide  and my project is a maven project.  
 here's what i've got         the code is attached to a button on my spreadsheet that is supposed to bring open a box asking whether or not they have a gmail account. if they choose \"yes\" then it should send the email to me and give them a confirmation window saying \"email sent!\". if they choose \"no\" then i want it to bring up a box to download the file so they can email it on their own. after all of that it should clear the designated cells.    if you choose \"no\" it says \"typeerror: showurl is not a function  it is undefined.\"    if \"yes\" it says \"cannot find method alert(string button).\"  but the email is still sent. and neither choice currently clears the cells.  
 in our project my teammate notice unusual behavior for radio button  when inside action listener there is swingutilites.invokelater call. archetecture of the action listener doesn't allow to avoid this call because is designed to start another thread  and then there is a switch back to awt thread.    is there a way to fix this? i mean change the state of displayed component.

 i recently noticed that my path setting in windows had incorrect pointers to older versions of java. what is odd is that the java -version command still works at the command prompt and it gives the version of java that does correspond to the latest jre i have installed. this is also the version represented in control panel and it is the vm version referenced by eclipse. what i'm confused about is how does the command prompt know where to find the java executables if the path is set incorrectly?  
 i have downloaded the gohu font (which is programmer font meant to be used at 14pt) from here   https://github.com/koemaeda/gohufont-ttf  and i'm trying to display some text with it.    this is what it looks like in gimp at 14pt (nice and sharp):         and now this is what i get when loading the font using plain 14 in a jtextarea:         i've tried disabling anti aliasing with          and         but it didn't help. any tips? thanks  
 i want to know how i can get at least the url from the user's profile image from a status object.    this for statement is the one that generate a timeline in my android application.     the only thing that lasts is to get the url from the status object.        
 i'm trying to render a list of records in a jsf page with a query that returns many records  i'm using weblogic 10.3.0.0 and sql server driver 4 from microsoft to connect a sql server database  when i run this jsf page  this consumes a lot of memory because the query returns many record and therefore a outofmemoryerror is occurring. i've seen that with setfetchsize you can limit the results  but here:      what does statement.setfetchsize(nsize) method really do in sql server jdbc driver?     the microsoft's sql server driver not limit this  i used jdts driver as the above post has suggested  but the same problem ocurre  i've also tried to use this:     http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb879937.aspx     for use adaptive buffering with the driver  but my driver version is 4 so this by default has adaptive buffering  but apparently no  i've tried this:         but this no returns results  i've put this in the connection properties also  but the problem still occure  i understand that the problem is the query have big results and the driver no execute it with chunks  and therefore the memory is decreasing  and i believe that this is the problem. i don't know who workaround use  if do the manual pagination with the query  if use another driver  etc.  please help me to find a workaround  whatever info is well received  sorry for my poor english  
 my service endpoint recieves a list of metric every minute along with their timestamps. if a metric passes certain conditions we nedd to store them in a cache  so that they can be accessed later. the access functions for this service are -         my curent solution is to use 3 guava caches with time based eviction set to 5  10 &amp; 15 minutes. when somebody calls one of the above functions  i return all the metrics from the relvant cache.    there are 2 problems with this -       guava cache start timing for eviction based on when the value is put in the cache (or accessed  depending upon setting). now its possible for a metric to be delayed  so the timestamp would be earlier than the time when the metric is put in the cache.   i dont like that i have to create 3 caches  when one cache with 30 mins should suffice  it increases memory footprint and complexity in cache handling.      is there a way to solve these 2 problems in guava or any other out of box caching solution ?  
 in my program an array   of fixed length [7] of objects is created  each object is a class   that contains 3    an    and an  . these values are read from a .txt file and added to a specific index of the array based on the value of the  . there are less entries in the .txt file then there are indices in the array so the array ends up looking something like this:         later in the program i need to sort the array based on the average of the   in the  . i have a working method to return this but when i try to sort the array using   and   i get a long list of errors starting with these:         my   method looks like this and it's located in a class that implements  :         and i'm trying to call this method to do the sorting:         i have tested it with a .txt file that contains enough entries to fill the array and the sort works correctly in that case  so i believe the problem i'm having is that my sort method can't sort an array with null elements in it. is there any way this can be achieved?  
 i have a fairly complicated program that i have setup. in that program is a preferences window. one of the preferences is the server that the program is connected to. when the user changes that server  or adds another  the program needs to \"restart\" (dispose of and recreate the   class).    however i am lost on the best practices of how to do this. here is the basic scenario in a stacked approach:      overall class  used for starting. creates the main window class.      jframe that displays the data to the user      jframe that has many user settable options      jframe that when the user hits ok  must restart the program    anyways  my question is how do i notify main that something happened in servereditordialogbox  and the program needs to restart. should i throw an exception? should i have a listener chain sedb->prefs->main_window->main? or should i do something entirely different?  
 i am trying to write a java plugin for the android monkeyrunner to check the wifi state. i would like to use the  android api wifimanager  to get the current wifi state and return it back.    the error message in eclipse is:  the method getwifistate() is undefined for the type monkeywifi     how can i change the code to be able to get the current wifi status?    this is the code i have so far:         }  
 in the example below  if i try to access the enum through an instance of class1 from class2  i get the error: \"unexpected type\":         i can access it using   which led me to believe that i can't access it using an instance because the enum is static  but i can access other static variables through the instance  so there must be more to it than that.    so why does this happen?       also  i know this probably should be another question  but i'm including this here as an aside in case it's an easy answer: is there some way for me to access the enum from an instance and still maintain the convenience of the enum's auto-completion in an ide (netbeans in this case).     i tried to return the enum in a static method from class1 in hopes of exploiting the fact that i can access static methods from its instances:         but when i access it on class2  netbeans fills the options with methods from    and not specifically from  .    i could just use    but i'm trying to avoid using the class' name in here for convenience and type-safety  because this code will be reused in different places.  
 for example i know that when checking strings  you can do something like         but is there a way to check if a char matches a list of possibilities? or do i have to check one by one  such as         ...ect.  
 i've been working with certificates  symmetric and asymmetric keys  and things related to web application security. i am developing a web application in tomcat 7  and i must perform a secure exchange of data between client and server using tls. in my research  i found the  keystore explorer  (v. 5.1).    i have some questions related to the use of this program. i know that here may not be the appropriate place to make these types of questions  because the site owner of keystore explorer has a  forum . however  the forum does not allow me to create new topics.       when we create a new key pair  we face a window which asks us to choose the algorithm used for the pair generation. after choosing  key generation is made  and then a new window is displayed to the user with the strange name \"generate key pair certificate\":         it is on this screen that comes some doubts. in this new screen  the program request the user to choose a signature algorithm  a validity period  and the name  where data from user entity's key pair must be filled.    what does it mean? am i creating a digital certificate signed by myself? and if i am  is there a way to create only a key pair? i was not supposed to create a pair  and from that create a csr to send it to a certificate authority with csr containing ( then ) the details of the entity requesting the digital certificate (in case  me)?    with the  keytool   i believe we can create a key pair only. but the funny thing is that when we create a keystore with a key pair with the keytool  we open the generated file with the keystore explorer and the pair seems to have been signed by the creator himself  as a digital certificate  for instance:         (note that we have two fields  \"subject\" and \"issuer\"...)    what i really want is to be able to create a key pair and from that pair generated i want to create a csr. i know in the program itself comes with documentation. i researched and read the part named \"key pairs\" (the \"generate key pair\" topic and etc.)  but unfortunately i could not solve this confusion. would someone please explain to me what am i doing wrong and what this all mean?     as always  i thank you all for your attention and time.    bibliography:     https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/keytool.html      https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/java-keytool-essentials-working-with-java-keystores      https://www.sslshopper.com/article-most-common-java-keytool-keystore-commands.html      http://ruchirawageesha.blogspot.com.br/2010/07/how-to-create-clientserver-keystores.html      http://keystore-explorer.sourceforge.net/releases.php

 i am using example from   here       my code snippet is as follows:-         }    if i comment out the 'line generating error' i get 10 results links. but if i give any value like 20 or 25 for more results. i get following error:-         what is the correct way of retrieving more than 10 results on google custom api? do i have to generate a new key / id etc or is the issue pertains to some other facet. thanks.  
 i am searching for a way to tell this call  which takes about 20-120 seconds:         to stop if thread.interrupt() is called;    because i just want to call that once  i cannot run some stuff in a while(thread.currentthread.isinterrupted()) loop and throw an interruptedexception. i can run if isnotinterrupted before and after the call  but still  how to stop this line of code??  
 i'm working in a webapp and this is the first time that i'm using java based configuration. i have a bunch of class to configure all:      applicationcontext   persistencecontext   securitycontext   webappinitializer   webmvccontext      now i'm defining spring data repositories and the service layer so i need to inject the repositories there. normally i would use autowired but i've read that it  is preferable to define the injections manually  so the question is  where?    maybe neither of the previous configuration classes is suitable for such task but  do i have to create a single class to define all the injections or is better to have on for each function? what happens if the project grows too much?    i think that the main question would be what is best way to organize dependencies in a spring project. what do you do?    i add here an image of the structure of the project as a petition. i'm trying to decouple layers and now i need to inject userrepository to userservice.       
 i am new to redis. i want to use priority queues in redis via java client. i will have a set of  key value pairs. and use this as a priority queue.    the data set contains keys and its corresponding values. example [a:1 b:1 c:1]. the value field will represent the number of times the key is present in the data set. if another key \"a\" is inserted into the data set  then it becomes [a:2 b:1 c:1].     here comes the priority. the most of keys present in the set will be of highest priority  in the example its [a]  and it should be at the top of the queue. so when i pop the queue  the element with highest priority should pop out.     also if the data set looks like this [a:2 b:2 c:2]  then i want to pick the random one to pop out of the queue.    since my data set will be of key  value pair i want to use redis[you may suggest a better one].   
 i have the following code:         environment.getscript() returns the current abstractscript    however  this abstractscript might be null  but the s (which is an abstractscript) returned at getscript() must not be null because it is used many times  therefore i don't want to null check it all the time.    i thought of null checking environment.getscript()  but in the case of null i don't know what to return then.  
 i have an application client that is attempting to connect to a wildfly 8.2 server using the remote jndi (http-remoting) protocol. below is my initialcontext configuration:         the wildfly server is configured to use the standard applicationrealm. when i attempt to authenticate  i get the following in the client console:         after debugging the client connection code  i think the server is sending plain as an acceptable sasl mechanism  but i can't get the client to use plain.  
 i have an application that is a maths game for kids. since i'm in college  i've usually only had a god object for all my past projects but for this applciation i've split my code into multiple classes:       : main class which initialises components and constructs and controls the ui.    : contains methods for use on the difficulty selection screen.    : contains methods for use on the game screen.    : contains methods for use on the end game screen.    : extends   and sets layout to   and adds a matte border.      each screen that the 3 xscreen classes control is simply an instance of   and screens are switched to using a   container  .    i'm wondering how i can divide my code to each class so that they are properly abstracted but i'm not entirely sure how to approach this.        should my 3 screen classes be extending from my   so these then can be instantiated?    so instead of having my       and   classes solely containing methods related to each screen which are then called from    each screen will control itself within its own class.     if yes to the previous question  should the ui components for each screen be made inside that screen's class?    at the moment  all components for each of the three screens are created in my   constructor. this makes the connection between a screen and the class which 'controls' (i use this word very lightly at the moment) it even further apart. so each screen is just an instance of   whose components are constructed in  . the only relation the   classfor examplehas to the end game screen is that when the   causes the end game screen to be displayed  anything done there makes a method in   be called from  .       i hope i explained myself well. if not  leave a comment and i'll clarify. any help would be greatly appreciated!  
 i need to be able to get the http header code in android which is going to be generated by a php code.     i am very new to android and not able to grasp the correct way to do it.     currently the code i have on my signup.java file is able to post some data to the php based webservice and depending on the data sent the webservice echo a json encoded response.    the php code for response when an error occurs is         and the code on success is         this will generate a json ecoded response message.    my signup.java file has the following code         i want to know if   will hold the http header response code being generated by the webservice or will i need to parse the json response message to understand what is being returned by the webserivce.  
 i am trying to build a 2 dimensional array that holds values from a data sheet and then takes those values and displays them within a website application form. i keep getting         the method getcell(int) is undefined for the type hssfsheet      error and i'm not sure why.       
 i'm getting an error in my program about a class not being found. i have double (and triple) checked and the class is definitely in my jar - it's finding other classes from the same jar just fine.    to help with debugging this  i want to turn on verbose class loading logging as described here:  http://java.dzone.com/articles/how-use-verbose-options-java     that doesn't say how exactly to turn on this option if you're using websphere liberty profile  though  so i looked around some more and found this:  http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssd28v_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/twlp_admin_customvars.html     this says that i need to place the line in  .    so i wrote a simple file which consists only of:         and i saved that to    which means the new file is in the same directory as my   folder  my   folder  and my  .    i stopped my server and started it back up and looked in the   directory. it generated the same logs as always  nothing new:          and  . i checked all of these log files and none of them have anything like the output from my first link.    so i don't think i'm doing this properly. here are the three points where i think i may have gone wrong:       was my file too simple? is there more that i need to put in it than just  ? does that perhaps need to be nested in something? are there more parameters that i must have? prior to this i didn't have any   file at all  so i assume that it'll use default values for anything i'm not explicit about.     did i put the file in the proper place? as far as i can tell from the documentation  i think i put it in the proper spot  but the docs are a bit less explicit than i would like.     am i looking in the right place for the logs? what will the name of the log file be? where will it be placed? i assumed it would be in the logs directory just like all of the other logs generated by websphere liberty profile  but maybe i'm incorrect?     
 the interface in question is      which defines this method:         my really simple implementation is this:         at the point marked   in this code extract  strangely enough  idea (since this is my ide of choice) tells me that declaring that exception is unnecessary...    since idea is not without bugs  i decided to try it out. i removed the exception and it compiled! so  idea is right.    and then i recalled that if you implemented   your were not required to throw      which is  also  a checked exception  for your code to compile (not that this is the canonical reommendation  of course). even though   's   throws it .    and indeed  when you   clone() and do not declare it to throw    it still compiles.    but.    then i tried this:           is supposed to throw   but so far it compiles; however  if i:         then this is a compilation error...    what is what?        edit  ok  there is a major difference;   does  not  define  ;   does.  
 i am using apache poi xssf apis to remove one or more rows from an excel sheet. below is the code for deleting multiple rows in a single activity.         the above code works okay when the rows that i need to delete do not have cell comments.  when they have cell comments  the comments stay behind and are assigned to rows that are shifted to the deleted row's place  which is not what i want.    same is the case when i need to delete only one row and that happens to be the last row.  in that case  my code does not shift the rows since it is the last row.     i am aware of the fact that using removerow() does not 'delete' the row  as happens when we right click on an excel row and choose delete  and instead clears the row of data as happens when we choose a row in excel and click on the delete keyboard button. i also noticed that the latter action also does not clear cell comments.    i would like to know if anyone else had noticed this issue and what was your fix for it. i can parse through all the cells in the row that i want to delete and remove cell comments if they are present  but i do not want to do this.   
 i was just curious is it possible that a thread t1 say executes a synchronization block partially and then releases the lock on the object and another thread t2 executes the same block? something like this:         is it possible that thread t1 acquires a lock on current object ( ) and executes line1 and line2. then thread t1 is preempted by thread t2  t1 releases lock and t2 acquires lock on   and executes the same block (all the lines1 to 5). then thread t1 again takes the lock and continues executing from line3?    basically  t1 will see   as null and so will t2 and each will create a new object.    if this is not possible can someone explain why not?    addendum:    thanks everyone for your answer. my question was a bit misleading. what i am exactly asking  is it possible that once a thread is executing a synchronized block it can release the lock before the entire block is executed (not by explicitly calling   but something which is process  cpu dependent)? is there a contract in jls or a jvm guarantee that once a thread starts executing a synchronized block the lock on the object is not released until the end of the block? my understanding is synchronization guarantees no 2 threads can simultaneously execute the block (or other synchronized method/block) but the lock is hold until the end of the block is reached? it's kind of obvious but is it specified in the jls?   
 i want to create one source folder: \"src\". in this folder i  want to create two sub folder: one \"java\" for source and \"test\" for testing code.    when i want to create sub folder into the \"src\" folder  the eclipse just flat it in the project view.  
 i'm interested in adding a \"play time\" line into my apps \"statistics\" page. however i need a good method to measure the time my app has been opened. what is the best and most efficient way of setting this up? my app consists of multiple activities  so it needs to be able to run through any activity. my mainactivity never closes  it does open other activities that do close onfinish(). so i guess running a timer could occur during mainactivity?  
 i am using hazel cast in a 2 node cluster following is my configuration:         i am just using the map to check the partition   so that i can run only one instance of batch in a cluster:         but time and again in the log i see messages like         not sure what is filling up the hazelcast cluster memory.    any dvice will be highly appreciated.    i am using hazelcasr version 3.1.7

 i have been stuck at a question where i read from a file  line by line and store those lines as a string inside an arraylist. that list is then cycled through to find an int which comes after \"rings=\" the pattern i use is \"(?&lt;=rings=)[0-9]{1}\" i have a print statement in the following code to show me this int but it is never used meaning the method probably does not find that int. an example of where it gets the int from is.         the code is        
 i'm looking at a situation that requires a fair bit of data storage that i have considered using sessionscope variables for. in a small test that i ran this worked well  but the data does get written back to the server with each change to the data. i'm considering creating a java bean to update and control the structure of this data and store it in a series of sessionstorage variables. the sessionstorage is easy in csjs but i'm not sure how to access these variables from a java bean.  the application is something like a shopping cart so i would maintain the data in the sessionstorage until the document submit  then load the values into the document and save it and i think this would work best as a java.  
 i have two classes parameter and parameterlist. the parameterlist class is an arraylist made up of parameters. there is a method getparameterbykey that finds the parameter in the list by key value. i don't want to mock parameter.getvaluestring() since i want the value to be different depending on the key and that would require mocks for each key/value. any input is appreciated.    i want to say go get the key \"a431\" and return \"boston\" (etc) but i am getting  \"java.lang.nullpointerexception\".       
 my end goal is to confirm that i have java  selenium webdriver  and junit functioning such that i can run an automated test case utilizing these technologies.     what i have done so far:      installed selenium ide (v 2.8.0) for firefox (v 34.0.5)   recorded a simple test case using selenium ide and added the test case to a test suite   in selenium ide exported the test case using the option: file->export test case as...->java / junit 4 / webdriver   downloaded and installed junit 4 from:  https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/download-and-install  (plain-old jar method)   downloaded and installed selenium client and webdriver java language binding (v 2.44.0) from:  http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/    performed some slight modifications to the code generated in step 3 such as removing the package statement at the beginning   compiled the code with the following command (windows command prompt):           this compiles with no warnings/errors      attempt to execute the code with the following command:           actual result:    the output of this attempt is:         no other error/warning is given and no indication is given that the code begins to execute    expected result:    this is my first time interacting with these technologies so i'm learning as i go! however  based on the research i have done my expectation is that a local selenium webdriver instance will be initialized as a firefox driver. this firefox driver will be sent instructions by the java code in order to carry out the steps in the test case. junit will then indicate somehow on the command line the pass/fail status of the test case.    the big assumption i have here is that the selenium server/selenium rc is not required in this case since all i intend to do is execute a local selenium webdriver script. furthermore  my hope is that this can be launched directly from the command-line independent of eclipse  maven  etc. i would like to be able to send the final java class to a colleague and the only dependency for expected execution would be a working sdk of java on the end machine.    what's next?    i'm looking for advice on what i can do to get this code up and running under the restraints i have outlined. it may be that the code needs to be modified. it may be that my expectations need to be tempered down and it's just not possible to do everything i want directly  from the command-line . it may be that i did not compile the code correctly or some library is missing. it may be that... okay you get the point!    other relevant details:    os = windows 7 - 64 bit    here is the contents of testgoogleapp.java:       
 my app contains a subroutine which is:         and i run this on my ui thread by calling         i really don't know what the problem is. i've implemented this kind of method before which apparently is working and i wonder why it gives me can of worms this time. when i run its just keeps saying unfortunately the app stops and i need to force close.

 i am trying to create an object which has two parts  a string and a method. for my handling of this i want the user to be able to do add(instance) or add(string  lambda).    the way i understand it  i can't use an interface because they don't have public only properties (not static)  i can't use a class because then i couldn't pass it as an argument and i can't pass an interface then call the method directly because that would be bad practice.    so how / what is the best way to do this?    eg:         eg add:         eg usage:         edit: my current solution  feels like it would be bad practice  but it's the best i can come up with until someone else has a better idea.    interface (for the lambda to use)         class (for instancing)         add method         usage:       
 i'm currently working on (an existing) android app using native c++ code. i want send a broadcast to another android java app listening to a broadcastreceiver. the receiving app is yet working  but i can't figure out how to broadcast data from jni code either directly or by sending the values to java code and them broadcasting it from java.         i hope my explanaion is clear. can someone help me on how to accomplish this?    thanks!  
 i want my app to be able to use a global   instance. i have code that does that  but i have encountered a race condition  i believe.    i am storing some variables for   like so:         and using them like so:         but it does not wait like i expect  and i instantly receive a   that the returned private key is not valid with my sanity check (it's probably null).    the code works if i let   finish initializing  but i'd like the program to do that for me.    i've tried some other synchronization techniques such as locks  but apparently as soon as you know if an object has a lock your info is stale.    what is the best thread safe approach to have the caller of   wait if   is not initialized properly?     edit:     i would like to add that through some debugging  i have found that i do not want be waiting for process to initialize (because what i have does that)  but rather  that the shell spawned by   is valid to accept further commands. i suppose i could have a thread pipe something like   and loop until i get   back  but that seems like that would waste cpu horsepower. if someone could lend some knowledge on the subject  i would be extremely grateful.  
 i am packaging a component into a jar file  and attempting to install it to another system for development. i am installing the file with maven as follows (taken from  https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-install-plugin/examples/custom-pom-installation.html ):         maven reports the jar as being successfully installed:         and  i see both the jar and the pom file placed into /home/user/.m2/repository/com/myorg/myjar/1.2-snapshot/. however  none of the dependencies are being resolved and downloaded by maven. extracting from myjar and examining meta-inf/maven/com.myorg/myjar/pom.xml  i see the dependencies listed as i expect:         but the .pom file in my local .m2 repository doesn't list any dependencies or other information about the jar. the only information it contains is:         attempting to code projects which use myjar components leads to exceptions like:         which makes sense  since at no point did maven resolve the dependencies for myjar.    is there a flag or command i'm missing to have maven resolve these dependencies? if necessary  i can extract the jar to a temporary directory and leverage the pom file directly  but it seems like an unnecessary step when maven is already capable of diving into the jar to find the pom file for the groupid and other fields.    edit: to make this clear  while i have access to the source for myjar  the goal is that myjar can be given to third parties without source. i'm trying to identify the steps so that when given myjar  a third party can install it and any related dependencies and develop locally. preferably with command-line arguments to maven.  
 objective:    i was writing a   application to read large text files  where data is represented in the format of character columns.. e.g.:         i.e. single alphabet separated by a space.  each such row has millions of such characters.  and each file has several such lines.     setup:    my job was to manipulate the file by columns. so i read the file line-by-line  split on   and created array. from such arrays  i created a 2-d array. everything was fine as i tested it on a small file  with 10 rows. but it started failing when i read files with say 500 rows. my machine and   have lots of memory  so i didn't expect this. hence i did some profiling and saw that  reading the lines into   was taking a lot more memory than expected. hence i changed   to  . memory usage came down dramatically and everything was fine.     question:    my question is why does   takes so much more space than  ? is it because it is like an array of objects? (since string is also an object). if someone can explain the low-level details  that would be really great.    edit 1:    here is what i was doing before:         this is what i changed it to:         let me know if more info needed.  
 i am new to spring     i have a controller class as follows:    i am trying to set a oilcount value  so i do a post/put request.    when  set content type as application/json  it is working fine  but when i set as text/plain it is not working.         assuming that adding consumes might solve the problem  i added following to the code         but still i am getting the same error    org.springframework.web.httpmediatypenotsupportedexception: content type 'text/plain' not supported    what am i missing?  
 i have an annotationprocessor that reads spring webmvc annotations and generates code based on what it finds.    the code works great  but i need to figure out how to unit test a method that takes a   as an argument and spits back it's string type representation  including generics (e.g.   is an example of what it would return if i passed a   representing a   as an argument.    so in order to unit test this method (i based my code on this answer:   getting the qualified class name of generic type with java 6 annotation processor ) i would like to either mock or create a typemirror during unit testing.    in my actual code i get the   i need using    but running a debugger leads me to discover that the actual implementation of variableelement is a core java class  not part of the api:  http://www.docjar.com/docs/api/com/sun/tools/javac/code/symbol $varsymbol.html    and the typemirror impl is this  similarly buried in a non-public-facing part of the jdk:  http://www.docjar.com/docs/api/com/sun/tools/javac/code/type $classtype.html    i'd rather not go instantiating internal java types - what's the \"right\" way to instantiate a   (or  )? has anybody mocked one out where they could give me an example?    this is the method i want to unit test:       
 i'm volunteering at my local public library  and helped the ladies update their computer which had never(or almost) been. i updated jave 6.0 to java 8.25  but now the security setting of medium is gone  and they can't access part (most of it) of the program used to rent books.the site they connect to is the following:     http://delson.mondoin.com:4113/portfolio/fr/     i've added  http://delson.mondoin.com:4113/  to the exception list in security setting of java  but doing so only permits the use of one of the part of the program.    this one is working with the previous exception added to the list:      i've tried opening 2 other jnlp file to find if there was another address i should add to have them working  but i never programmed in java  and have done 1 years of vb+ something like 12years ago at school so it's seriously over my skills.    the 2 i tried to find hints of what is missing are the following:  http://delson.mondoin.com:4113/portfolio/fr/work/bsacq.jnlp   http://delson.mondoin.com:4113/portfolio/fr/work/bscir.jnlp     if anyone with some knowledge could point me out the way  it would really be helpful!    edit: after looking at the bscir.jnlp file  i added the port 4108  4119 and 4124 to the exception list because they appeared in the jnlp  but it didn't help.  
 i've got an issue trying to select items from a dropdown menu on a javascript webpage. my end goal is to fill in the menu value via a userform but i'm not having any success creating the vb to select the drop down. web code is below         i've tried various getelementsby  with both the above name  trying the below with the name and with id rtf[0].val1 but to no avail  example below. i believe going by the dateselector0 name will be best  but i would greatly appreciate input from those of you better at this than me.       
 i am trying to connect to hive using spring and jdbc connection. i am using the same sample that is in the spring book( https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hadoop-samples/tree/master/hive ) and i get the connection part successful but when i run a query  it gets hanging and i never get the results back.    i have seen more posts with issues similar to this one  but none of them have been answered with a concrete/working answer.    can someone help me out here? i am starting to think that there is a problem with hive server 2 and the spring framework.    this is my code:         this is my hive-context.xml         this is my jdbc-context.xml         this is my hive.properties         this is my hive-server.properties     hive.exec.drop.ignorenonexistent=true    this is my pom           
 i'm currently having an issue with swing  where i am trying to get a button from tab 1  once clicked on  to go to tab 2. the two blocks of code that are at work here  as far as i know  are as follows:         and:         however  the latter piece of code is giving an error on calling the settab method:         i have tried making the settab method static  but then netbeans complains about the jtabbedpane not being static. i am not able to make the jtabbedpane static  as netbeans won't allow me to edit the code in this manner.    how can i fix this?  
 i am trying to figure out how to implement a proper way to represent a distributed array in javaspace but there appears to be a big drawback to my implementation as shown:-         i have a message class which implements entry for using in a distributed manner and a distributed array which allows an message to be linked by index and not as a composition.  when you add an message to the array you simply take it from the space and increment the array lastindex property while passing the incrementation to the message index such as:-         then you write the message and array back to the space.    there is a big flaw in this  i cannot remove any messages  only add them to the array index by incrementing it.  if i had a decrement method in the array class then i could only remove the last message and not any before it because i can't refer to previous messages.    is there a better way to solve this issue?  
 to help me learn java and programming concepts  i'm writing a bot that will solve the puzzles in the game  puzzlefreak  .     i've made the controller for the game a singleton  since there should be only one. however  now i have   peppered everywhere. how can i make this less verbose? is a singleton even the way to go here?     i could wrap the controller methods in default methods so that i could just call   in the   implementations  but that feels wrong.    below i have the player interface and an example implementation.    player.java:         startupplayer.java:       
 i have a top down 2d game where you walk around shooting bad guys. i want to be able to shoot towards the mouse  no mater what direction it is but i have absolutely no idea how to do this.    here is my   class:       
 i am trying to parse a simple xml file.  it looks like this         this is my parsing method:         i am building the passed document with this method.         everything is working great.  except for the cdata and countdown elements.  i want to just get the literal between the string elements.  however  the parser is only returning the text inside of cdata and stripping out the xliff tags.         i want the parsed strings to look like this so i can persist them literally.  i need to be able to reconstruct xml down the road with the meta data in the correct places.         are there are any configuration tricks for document in order to keep the nodes between two elements as literal strings?  for most users strpping cdata makes sense but i need to get around that.  
  note: for this question i attempted to add images but it said \"you must have reputation 10 to post images\".  i have no idea what reputation 10 is or what that means but i cannot post images.  sorry about that.     we have a table of columns.  this is part of an image as to how it looks:    when you hover over a column heading   such as 'created on'  some sort buttons (arrows) appear which are used to sort the data ascending or descending:    clicking on the arrow (manually or with selenium) will sort the data.  hovering over an arrow should give a tip \"sort ascending\" or \"sort descending\" as in the following:    physically hovering manually shows these popup tool tips; however  hovering over it it with selenium does not show the tip \"sort descending\" or \"sort ascending\".  the arrow still turns blue  but it does not show the tip:    i am not sure why this is happening unless the hover is not working correctly.  here is the function for hover:         i have tried a lot of other mouse actions but nothing works.  any suggestions?  
 i use eclipse ide i compile the project including two class  first time i took the content of the constructor of test class in main method  then i run the project a pop-up window is appear but just a frame  it don't contain two panel that i put  second time i changed just like next two file  result is same with last  no panle  i am a newbie  maybe the question looks like easy but please explain more details  thank you!       
 when i run this long running process from the command line it takes about 30 seconds to complete. when i deploy this same code to tomcat7 and call the same function from a simple vaadin web application it takes almost 150 seconds. this is the time for a specific function to execute  not anything related to interface slowing it down.     here's is a simple example that illustrates the problem:          the server i'm running this on has 48 available cores. when i run this code from the command line i get 48 threads running ~98% each. when i run it through tomcat each thread tops out at around 82-86% according to top. if i decrease the number of threads in the code on tomcat  the % per thread increases. 12 threads will get me 92% per thread. 1 thread 99%...    does tomcat do something to limit this tread pool in some way  or have some additional overhead with threads that i am not aware of? or is there a better way to multi-thread in this case? some overhead is obviously acceptable  but something doesn't seem right here for it to take that much longer through tomcat.   
 i was trying to implement something like guava's  nulltoempty  without making two calls to a method.    my original call is:         which i tried to shorten to:         but i get       and  .    this works:         what's wrong with declaring and assigning at the same time in an expression?  
 i am attempting to update a value in my application  lets call it a foo object.  foo is immutable as a java object but can be updated in the database via a hibernate entity.  i am accessing foo objects by calling a loading cache overlay (guava cache as the implementation) that loads the value from the database when it isn't present.  in addition  there will be few writes but many reads to foo objects  though concurrent writes are possible.    what is the best way to update a foo object?  locking the cache on update?  some other structural design?    note  there is definitely information on this subject out in the vast internets  but i read so much of it trying to figure this out that i confused myself.  i am currently leaning towards a reentrantlock on the update method of the cache implementation class  but it seems like there should be a better way.  
 i have a java clasa (not a hook or portlet or anything like that  just plain java) that needs to use liferay's api to update its lucene index. i've found the methods to do what i need to do  but i still don't know how to connect to my instance of liferay to make sure that things actually go into my search engine. is there an easy way to open a connection to liferay and still use the api? i'd rather not use a remote connection since that seems to limit which methods i can access  but honestly i'll be happy with anything that works.    also  (and this is probably obvious from my question)  i'm very new at any kind of programming that involves using a connection  so if you are nice enough to respond  could you explain it to me like i'm stupid? thanks!   
 i'm having the problem that sometimes a thread that i've started finishes before i call   on it. it seems that this causes my program to wait for something that is not going to happen again ( ). how can i make sure not to wait for a finished thread?       
 i am making a game for androids using eclipse and i had some trouble trying to figure this out. i already have 2 images on my layout and i just want to figure out how to make them move one unit up the y axis with a timer that is repeatedly. thanks alot for any help appreciate it!  
 i have the class  :         and two classes   and  :         and in my   class:         if i call   (just random numbers)  the character goes to these exact coordinates. but the   also goes to  . so the   in   are overriden by the   call to  . how is this possible?     tl;dr  - two classes from      and    override eachother  . why?    for full source code:                     
 this code is illegal because bar cannot use the generic t since it belongs to foo  and bar is static. :(         my question is  is there a reasonable workaround to this problem? i really need foo and bar to use the same generic type since bar is a listener class for foo and needs to return the same type. of course i could use two generics (e.g.  ) and always assign the same type to t and p  but that is funky and error prone. is there a cleaner solution?  
 i have a csv file and in it there is a string representation of a date and time     2014-05-11t09:00:01.772401    i am trying to verify it follows this format.  my thought was to use a regex to match a pattern like 4 numbers followed by a - 2 numbers followed by a - and so on and so forth but i'm not familiar enough with regexes to build it.    is validation of a string matching a specific pattern best accomplished using regexes or should i use something else.  if regex is the way can you please provide the regex and explain what char's represent in the validation process.     also any links that could better explain regex pattern matching would be greatly appreciated.  
 i want to take an integer as input whose maximum value is 10^100000.    how to take such input in java    i took          but it didnot work    any suggestion?  
 i am fetching 10000 records at a time in a java program using a prepared statement. making a conneciton to sql server. i used sql server management studio profiler and can see my select statement runs for a few mins. looked at the sql server activity monitor and see that the process is in a async_network_io wait.     i am assuming java result set does not get all the data put into it all at once  gets chunks of information and query stays alive until all the records are fully received into the result set.    when i run the sql statment in sql server studio manager it runs very fast and results are retrieved quickly. so i know nothing is wrong with query  it's something to do with how java program is retrieving the records from database. how can i eliminate the async_network_io wait?    i have tried setting the fetchsize of both the prepared statment and result set but it makes no difference. any insight into how to get rid of async-network_io wait would be greatly appreciated.    the following is an example of what the code looks like:       
 i have two classes. one that has the array ( ) and the other ( ) has just a variable that will act as a simple reference to an array.     i add a new element to the array using  . then i check to see if the new element is visible in the  . but the test fails because it cannot find the new element. they act like they were different arrays. shouldn't they point to the same array?          update:  i did the same on test in java  it gives me an indexoutofboundsexception. does that mean both php and java works the same way in this aspect or is there something wrong with my code?       
 i have a piece of code and i am not sure why i am getting the concurrentmodificationexception         there is no thread using this code other then the main thread. any idea what am i missing  
 i am making a wordcounter  which has several threads counting the words in different files. i have gotten everything to work  except one little issue.     i cannot figure out a proper way to wait for the threads to finish. everything works if i set a thread.sleep to wait for a short amount of time  the only problem is that  this will not be a proper solution if the counter takes longer than the sleep does.         this is the code from the actual word-counter. i want my main-thread to wait for these word-counter threads to do the q.add(words); function before doing anything else.         this is the main-thread. i will need some sort of way to wait for the other threads to finish before i continue to my while statement at the bottom  but how?    thanks in advance.

 i'm trying to write an interface that is iterable and supports multiple levels of abstraction. i'm having trouble correctly defining the interface.    i've declared the following interfaces and classes (a toy example):         the following works:         but the following does not compile. java says the for-each loop variable should be of type object.         i know i can cast to appease the compiler in the second example  but that seems yucky. is there any way to declare interface c and subclass d so that i can support both iteration scenarios  or is that not possible? thanks!  
 in candlestick charts is common to draw candles' stroke color (green or red) according to if the stock is rising or falling. example of standard candlestick chart:         but in jfreechart ohlcseries there is only one option to set the stroke...         ...which is not enough for defining color of rising/falling candle separately.    example of jfreechart ohlcseries:          do you know a way to set a color for rising and falling candles separately?    
  i can do this:           however i cannot do this:           why i have to include the main method?   
 i have a javafx application that has child windows or stages. the way i handle how all stages interact with each other is like this: i have a static collection of classes called guicontainer in my main class. the guicontainer looks like this:         this way i have access to any stage or controller from anywhere.    all possible guicontainers are created only once at boot (in static main(string[] args)) and can then be statically accessed from anywhere  by anyone.    now... in the main application (scene inside the primary stage) i have a treeview that has a custom cell factory  and when a cell is right clicked an appropriate context menu is shown. inside this context menu i open a child/modal stage  like so:         now  here comes the problem. javafx doesn't request focus on the child stage. for instance  i can't type into a textfield (on the child stage) because i have an onkeypressed event registered on the primary stage and it captures all the keys i press. on this child stage i also have a combobox  and when i select an item from that combobox  the child stage finally comes into focus and the primary stage no longer captures the keys i press.    i also tried to change the modality to all posible values and read what they do on oracle.com  but none of the information helped me...    is there something wrong with my code? or could this be an issue with javafx? any ideas?     edit:  here is my application overriden start method: (i hope this provides more information)          edit2:  this is how i register the onkeypressed listener: (in my parent controller init() method)          edit3:  this is how my abstract controller class looks like - i hope this provides a better insight          important edit: this only happens on the mac platform  i ran the same application on windows and there were no such problems.   
 i need to have my precompiled root.war deployed in my openshift app.    under the complete path of the war is       i've checked this war file before doing git push that the   is there. this js file is there in the index.html. now when i access the app online  the index.html cannot find this js file. so it means the pre-compiled root.war was not deployed  instead it seems it built a new root.war.     what am i missing here?

 i have a web project developed in jsf 1.2  richfaces 3.3  jdk 1.7  tomcat server 7.0.55 and gson 2.2.1.jar using eclipse ide 3.4. i am using google api example from   here   in eclipse to retrieve results. my application was functioning correctly retrieving results. however  all of a sudden i have started receiving error. my code snippet is as follows:-         and the error i received is :-         what could be possible cause of generation of this error all of a sudden. i am new to java and all. so please forego any naive-ness.  
 perhaps i'm not understanding gradle's configurations properly  but i can't seem to make sense of what's going on here. i need org.glassfish.web:javax.servlet.jsp.jstl:1.2.1 in my war because tomcat doesn't provide jstl  so i put the dependency on the runtime configuration (it's not needed for compilation). the tomcat configuration also requires this package. however  the tomcatrun task will only work if the dependency is only added to the tomcat configuration. if the dependency is added to runtime  or to both runtime and tomcat  or to neither  the following stack trace results:         the gradle code is as follows. the offending line is commented out  allowing tomcatrun to work successfully but preventing my war from working. when the line is uncommented  tomcatrun fails and the war works.       
 i am having issues using java generics - specifically  using wildcard capture. here is a simplified version of the code i have that exhibits the problem i am seeing. it is driving me crazy:         package declaration and imports are not included - otherwise this is complete. this does not compile. the problem is with the fragment   where i am seeing the error message :         i can see from other posts that helper methods are suggested as a way get things like this to work  but i have not been able to come up with one that works.    the   has the type parameters like so:   and the   that i am passing in to the   method is of interface type 'actionsubject' and of concrete type 'actionsubjectimpl' although the code fragment in question will not see the concrete type of course. the second type parameter of   should support any type that extends   - and it is fine when i set   to    where the second type is  .    i would appreciate any comment on what i am doing wrong here in my definitions and use of generics. i may be missing something basic here. i could code this a different way  but until i understand what is going wrong i won't be able to move on.    thanks.  
 i have a quick question about type safety    i have this method and a class variable defined:         now  i get a warning on the assignment in the if. it says  .    first the getcurrentinstance method in configurationbean is:         ... and the getmeta method (and instance variable) is:         the getlistbait() method from the metadatabean looks like this:         so from what i understand it should not give the warning in question...? anyone  who can explain this to me - the suggested solutions don't seem to solve the problem (apart from the @suppresswarning ;-) ).    this is on java 1.6.    thanks in advance!     edit   ... and going through this edit actually solved it!    what had happened was that probably some friendly advice from eclipse \"helped\" me define the metadatabean like this:         ... and that does not make sense. i can't tell when that little \"\" has been added to the declaration - but removing that made all the warnings disappear :-)    thanks a lot!! - now i still trust a little in what java i know so far ;-)    /john  
 database: oracle version 11.2.0.4    persistent layer: hibernate    query:         above query is generated by hibernate and takes around 4606ms to execute but when i execute the same query in toad it takes only 15ms. i'm wondering what happens in hibernate to slow down the query.    i have done the following:       the columns casenumber  program_program_id indexed ie.  each column is indexed separately      when i remove the like search on the column \"casenumber\" and make it exact search the query through hibernate is considerably fast and take 500ms.     i'm using ojdbc6.jar as this is the oracle jdbc jar file which is compatible with java 1.6     the dba's are confirming that there is absolutely no problem on the database side since the queries are running withing a few milliseconds (ie. 15ms at the most)       i want to know the following:       i dont have much knowledge on query plans and statistics. how can i take these info and analyze?     even if i take the query plans is it going to help in anyway as the query runs very fast in database server.     can i conclude that the problem is in hibernate layer which fetches the record using jdbc connectivity? is there any setting which i need to look into in hibernate which might quicken the response time.      should i tweak each and every query to improve its performance.      should i use a different version of jdbc jar file for the oracle version mentioned above.       please as am hitting a roof top on this issue need some help asap.   
 how does pods that are controlled by a replication controller and \"hidden\" behind a service in kubernetes write/read data? if i have an application that recieves images from the user that needs to be persisted  where do i store that? because of the service in front i have no control over which node it is stored at if i use volumes.   
 when trying to solve this problem  https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/cut-the-tree  i was trying to always pick and cut a leaf and then combine its weight to the node that it connects. i was using a priorityqueue to store all the nodes  and using the size of their adjacent nodes as the priority. but when i'm trying some test case  it seems that the priority queue property is violated  which means that non-leaf nodes may appear before leaf nodes. will priorityqueue automatically update itself or should i call some function to update it. my temporary solution is to use a list to store all the leaves.    the following is my code:         thanks.

 i am creating my first android which will take data from a signup form and send it to a php backend.     the php backend will take the data and save in a database and give a jason encoded message telling if it is success or not.    now i want to eliminate the possibility of dupilicate usernames so when the android app sends data to the php backend i will first check and if it is duplicate i will throw an error message like this          on success the backend will send something like this          how do i enable the android app to read this info and understand if the user was created or an error occured.    my current android signup.java code looks like this       
 i have was 6.1 on   physical nodes  one application server   for each node. i have a queue implemented in websphere mq which is consumed by an mdb pool (one for each server).    i need  in some specific cases  to limit the number of messages consumed to a number    with   possibly lesser than  . (this is because each consumed message produces a call to an external system which could have overload issues).    now i know i can do this in each   separately  but what if   and i want my mq  in simple words  to work as in a monolithic environment? is there some \"shared configuration\" i can do?

 problem:    hello  i am trying to run espresso unit test for android and one problem i am facing right now is static method is giving me a no class found error  help please.    code:         stack trace:                 gradle    dependencies {         environment:    android 1.0.1 gradle 1.00  
 i tried to compile the following code:         but i get this error: \"foo.this cannot be referenced from a static context.\"    specifically  i get it on the \"t\" in bar(t t). however foo(t t) does not produce the same error. i don't understand why that's a static context and what the error really means.   
 in java  i would like to determine the current stack of the thread which populates the result of the future when a timeoutexception occurs. it seems that the top entry in the stack trace provided by a timeoutexception only indicates where future.get() was invoked  not the state of the background thread. for example:         in this example i've found that the top entry is the future.get(1  timeunit.milliseconds) entry  not the thread.sleep(10000). i would like the stack trace to indicate thread.sleep(10000) since this is what is currently being executed. is there an elegant way of doing this?     i've found that if there is an actual execution problem  then the executionexception.printstacktrace() will indicate where the problem occurred in the background thread.  
 i am trying to get the html source of a webpage through java code using jsoup. below is the code i am using to fetch the page. i am getting a 500 internal server error.         however  when i fetch the same page with wget from command line  it works. a simple httpclient from code also works.          is there anything i would need to change in the parameters for jsoup.connect() method for it work?    this however does not happen for all urls. it is specifically happening for pages from this website:     http://xyo.net/iphone-app/instagram-rrkbufe/

 suppose i have a very large number of directories (say  ) in my filesystem and inside each directory there is a similar number of directories. each directory can contain any number of files  but typically not more than a few. this structure goes to a constant depth ( ).    my question is that is there a difference in time complexity (in the reading operation) if i read in a file from this directory structure like:   using    compared to reading a file form a simple file system like this:          note: this is just a theoretical question i just want to know whether the number of directories/files in the directory i'm trying to open a file from has any effect on the speed of the read operation.   
   when user reloads the page.   method is called i get the exception that the socket has already been closed. because of this  i cannot cleanup few things in a different thread that stops when the web socket session closes. everything is fine if user closes the session without reloading page (its basically a server side terminal over websocket). i am on tomcat8.    questions.      how to properly close the websocket session on the server if user reloads the page?   also how do i do a few things when webshocket session times out?      following is the code that servers the websocket connection.         i have a thread that is runs while socket is open  but when user reloads i don't see   in the output - which get printed on normal socket close. code for that thread.         error when user reload the page.       
 i'm trying to write some spock tests with groovy to test some java code (specifically a servlet filter). i have some   and   variables that i would like to mock  but i can't determine if there is a way to do this. i know   is available for methods  is there anything similar for variables?    for instance  i have:         i've tried using    as well as using java reflection to change the value (based on this question and answer  change private static final field using java reflection ).    i would like to do this without adding something like mockito or other frameworks  if that's possible  just use plain groovy and spock.    thanks for any ideas!     update 1     at least for   variables i did get the following to work:         but i still haven't been able to get around the   aspect.

 i have been stuck with a very strange problem with layouts &amp; fragments.     i have been assigned with fixing an app that has really poor logic &amp; design. it has single activity &amp; all layout changes are done by simply removing content on wrapper (linearlayout) and adding views to it.    i have been trying to inflate layout with &lt; fragment > inside. and it works just fine. but when i change wrapper content (removeallviews()) with different content and then try to reinflate layout with fragment again i get exception with:         while i remove parent layout (wrapper) - fragment is not executing any of the lifecycle functions (onpause  onstop  ondestroyview etc).    inflating &amp; reinflating later on:      destroying:      search xml:         any idea what i might do to clear it from fragmentmanager? is there an event i might use on layout to find out it is being removed?

 i have revised this question. i have two linkedlists  one for each object type (vertex  edge).  the linkedlist of edges prints  but the linkedlist of vertices does not. this problem persists if i switch the order or separate the code into two methods.    here is the print method         the linkedlist is not empty.  as i create it i print the size and see that it increases.  also  when i just print the raw list followed by a prefacing print of the size i get:    [com.expertdecision.topology.classification.structure.vertex@de6ced  com.expertdecision.topology.classification.structure.vertex@c17164  com.expertdecision.topology.classification.structure.vertex@1fb8ee3] surface: f1: consisting of 3 vertices    it seems like the vertex iterator isn't working as expected  but i use it the same way as i use the edge iterator.    here is the method that creates the linkdlist for the edges from an array of edges:         here is the method that creates the linkedlist for the vertices:

 i'm paraphrasing my code here  but my problem is thus.    i have a mocked class:         in my code i have a call to   that would be made during execution  so i stub it in a setup method:         during execution this can happen and in a test i can verify that  however there is a test where this interaction i have stubbed does not happen (do something is never called)  so i set up a test with those conditions and my initial thought is to verify this interaction does not happen:         or         when i run this test these verify statements fail with a message saying (again paraphrasing) no interactions were expected - pointing to these verify statements  but interactions were found. the message points to the stub in the setup method.     question 1:  the conditions in the test mean that   is never called during execution  and given (at least in my head) verification is to verify what did or did not happen during execution  why do the setting up of stubs interfere with this  ?     the quick solution is to move this stub out of the setup method and into the one test where this interaction is valid  which will give me the expected result from   in the other test.     question 2:  but what if i introduce a third test that also requires this stub...... i'd prefer not to duplicate the code that sets up the stub in this new test  and would want it in setup to avoid this duplication. is there a way to achieve this and still have   work as i expect  ?     hope i've explained myself well enough here :)    cheers    scribe     edit: code as requested     class under test         }    test class (i've removed the other tests to try and keep this short)    essentially what i expect is that because my test forces a pathnotfoundexception  the calls to   that i have stubbed should never happen  and debugging the code they don't  but alas the verification fails:

 i have a problem using   on android.    i followed this tutorial.  getting the google maps android api v2  to import it on eclipse  but when i add in my project reference google play services library and i try to run it on my nexus 5  eclipse starts an infinite launching and i must kill it.    i update all in sdk manager. what could be the problem?  
 i am using the code example from the microsoft azure java docs on this page:      http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/media-services-java-how-to-use/#setup-dev     the upload code in that example is also essentially the same as the java code snippet that the mediaservices portal displays after you create the service  pasted below. so this would seem to indicate that this code should be correct.    however  the last line of code (below)  the line that is calling createfileinfos  fails with an http 400 error in the exception.  i am using version 0.6.0 of the java media services jar.    any ideas? if this code works for people  perhaps there is a configuration problem on my end?        
 will the java compiler optimize this:         to this:         or even this:         i use the first way as a general practice for readability  but at what cost?     side note: java 8 is assumed. using jit. the booleans cannot be determined until runtime. the booleans are completely independent of each other. i probably won't stop using the first way either way  but i'm just curious. thanks!
