 as you write  you need a new transaction. from your code snippet it looks like the simplest thing would be to move   from the controller to the repository classes. as an alternative  you could add a service layer and move   there.    a different approach would be to pre-check the entity object before trying to save it in the entity manager  so that exception is never thrown.  
 you have to put the full path ..try to use         string file = session.getservletcontext().getabsolutepath();    
 you need to override  . java 7 provides a utility method for this.       
 you should also override   so that two equal instances have the same  . e.g.:         note that it is not strictly required for two instances that are not equal to have different hash codes  but the less collisions you have  the better performance you'll get from you  .  
 a hash map uses the   method of objects to determine which bucket to put the object into. if your object doesn't implement    it inherits the default implementation from  . from the  docs :        as much as is reasonably practical  the hashcode method defined by class object does return distinct integers for distinct objects. (this is typically implemented by converting the internal address of the object into an integer  but this implementation technique is not required by the javatm programming language.)      as such  each object will appear to be distinct.    note that different objects may return the same  . that's called a  collision . when that happens  then in addition to the    the hash map implementation will use the   method to determine if two objects are equal.    note that most ide offer to generate the   and   methods from the fields defined in your class. in fact  intellij encourages to define these two methods at the same time. for good reason. these two methods are intimately related  and whenever you change one of them  or implement one of them  or override one of them   you must review (and most probably change) the other one too.    the methods in this class are 100% generated code (by intellij):       
 you probably did not override the   method. why is that required ? to answer this  you must understand how an hashtable works.    an hashtable is basically an array of linkedlists. each bucket in the array corresponds to a particular value of  . all the objects with the same   will be stored within a linkedlist in the associated bucket and will be recognized (during the lookup for instance) basing on their   method. therefore  the exact specification is   which is equivalent to  .    if you use the default implementation of    which is based on the reference  then two objects that are equal but have a different reference (and so  most probably  a different hashcode) will be stored in a different bucket  resulting in a duplicate key.  
 there is a way  but it's not a good idea to do  as it defeats the purpose:         but don't do this. it defeats the purpose of the pattern. the purpose of the pattern is to use objects of type    without having to know how they work. the   method is only defined in    it's an implementation detail that should not be relevant to users of the   type. they shouldn't have to know. it's hidden. this is called good encapsulation and information hiding.  
 you need one more class using composition to decide which implementation is needed.         }    and about the ability to access member of impla or implb   no you cannot have that flexibilty with this patter  whole point of this pattern is that caller need not be aware of implementation details.  
 define an interface for the strategy and a factory with different overloaded methods to create the concrete instances of the classes. of course the methods are typed to the interface instead of the concrete classes.    the interface.         the first implementation.         the second implementation.         the factory.       
 first of all  change this         to         then. you may write this class         now here in this method.       
 sleeping in the event dispatch thread blocks it and prevents drawing from happening as you have found out. it also makes the rest of the ui unresponsive for the time  so it's in the list of things you should never do.    the standard way to run delayed  or repeated action in swing applications is using a swing  timer . it runs the action properly in the event dispatch thread  so that you also don't need to pay special attention to thread safety. using a   your button action becomes:       
 the default font eclipse uses for (java) code is monospace.  
 your itemwheat is declared at he beginning as final so it has to be initialised there or inside constructor.         in this case it will be even simpler than having it inside costructor  because if later you decide to add more ctors and call one inside the other you will have to manage init of finals.   
 those two assignments are  outside  the constructor  where you can only have field declaration code.    move them up a few lines so they appear  before  the line       
 in java everything should be in methods. the lines responsible for error are outside the constructor add them in the constructor and you are good to go.       
 there is no command for adding class from command line. just add necessary .java file with a text editor. java compiler will compile that class.  
 there are no tools to create java classes in an android project. you can however create  a new android project  with the sdk tools and modify it to some extent.     well  if you really want to do it via the command line:         create the java class:         add package and the class declaration to the java file:         if you want to create another package:         now if you go into eclipse everything should be updated.  
 if you use protected variables they can be accessed by any class that inherits them.         otherwise you can use getters and setters with the protected or public accessor with your variables being marked as private.     currently your variables are marked as default (no specified accessor) you can see what the different accessor allow you to do here:  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaoo/accesscontrol.html   
 you have 2 options       change   to   in order to allow the sub classes to have direct access to parent fields but yet preventing other classes to have direct access.          to          or you can create getter/setter (with proper access modifier) in parent class and invoke them from child class e.g.    
 as you have it  base class variables are by default  package private   having private access in derived class. in that sense  getter methods can be used for this cause  and are available on derived classes. please though have in mind that getters are normal methods and perform late binding  so be careful not to  apply same getter methods on derived classes which do something else  or else you will lose access to base variables  in a sense.  
 the first problem:             this doesn't work  because you must call   first before calling  . so this will be better:         the second problem is with the groups. given this pattern:             and these inputs:         both of these lines will match  but the matched part will be in different groups. for    \"acide flavodique\" will be in    but for    \"ciprofloxacine arrow 750 mg cp\" will be in  . this is because in your regular expression you have two  .  
 your pattern being:         this contains a few '/' characters which are considered unescaped delimeters rendering your pattern useless. you can test for such things here:  https://www.regex101.com/   
 you are calling m.group(..) too early. you should first call m.matches()  otherwise you get illegalstateexception.    and by the way  the pattern  is  found (at least the two examples you provide are matched).  
 unless you care which one is found  i guess you could combine the two so all that's  eeded is a single capture group 1.         
 currently  gvnix uses a dandelion datatables 0.9.2 custom-version which includes some patches  than hadn't been applied until 0.10.0 (it was due to release-time problems).     as far i know  we didn't make any test over tomcat 8  so i think you found a bug ;-). if you want  you could report it on  github project . now a days  i can't provide you any workaround to run it on tomcat 8.    i know that is planed to update dandelion version but i can't provide you any schedule.    regards.  
 this seems to be a problem with oraclesql. i'd suggest making sure you have the latest jdbc as this may have been patched.  
 you can use a class literal  for instance:         any type of class that extends (or implements)   will work.  
 if you simply wish to add a new element as the head of the array an easy way is to create a new array and copy the elements using  . then the new head-element can be added to index 0 as in the example below.

 there are two candidates:   and  . just check which of the two is closer.    for integers  you can  use bit fiddling to find the most-significant set bit  to get the exact value of  . i've  written about the idea before . again this yields two candidates that you can check.  
 mathematically speaking  the closest power of 2 would be 2 round(log 2 (x)) .  java  unfortunately  doesn't have a pre-made method for log 2   but luckily  it's easily doable with the pre-existing java.lang.math functions:       
 you can round up to a higher power of two (no change if it already was a power of two) like this:         it will give 0 for inputs where the next higher power of two does not exist.    the other candidate is simply half that. then take the nearest.  
 another option would be to exclude libraries that you don't use. for instance if you don't use jpa you can safely exclude it from the build via maven's  xml tag.    background: ninja 4 potentially bundles too many libraries by default. that's cool  because everything will work out of the box without thinking about libraries needed. the downside is that the jar/war may be too big for what you want to do. there are discussions on the way to make ninja more modular - feel free to chime in on our mailing list :)    but as written above - you can cut ninja's bundle down yourself using maven's exclude.  
 if you have to use all the dependencies  there is no way to avoid deploying them with your application.    you don't tell if you are deploying into a container (maybe tomcat). if you do  you can try to deploy the needed libraries into the container and set the maven scope to  provided  to avoid redeploying the libraries.    having the libraries provided by the container has benefits  but it can also be a burden. depends strongly on your deployment and operation processes.  
      seems wrong. with it new value of mat[j][i] is mat[j][i] - (mat[i][i] * mat[j][i]) which is != 0.     i think it should be         with it new value of mat[j][i] is mat[j][i] - (mat[i][i] * mat[j][i] / mat[i][i]) which is in fact 0.    also:         this is risky with doubles. i would advise something like math.abs(mat[row][row]) &lt; 1e-9    i hope that helps.  
 try seeking the clip to the beginning.         otherwise  the second time you call start there is nothing to play because the clip is at the end.  
 just remove the   all together. it's defined for dependency injection and this is not your case here since you use jndi to lookup the bean and set it in langaugefacade variable. just remove it and things will be fine.  
 it accesses the \"i\" field of the instance of the settype class.  
 the   is accessing the member variable   of that object.  
 the thing to understand here is that two things are done in one expression. first object   is cast into an object of class    this is the   part  then the field   of this object is accessed. it might help to think of this as the following two steps         note that the cast is safe  because you test   first  and that the cast is also necessary  as   is an instance of class   and thus doesn't have a field named    i.e.    would not work. for completeness  here's a fully \"expanded\" version of your code:       
 this code:             is a shorter form of this equivalent way of writing the same thing:         i hope you'll find this easier to understand. you can simplify this code to reach the original. they are equivalent.  
 you can use the method  . this should work  but i did not test it.         see  http://netty.io/4.0/api/io/netty/buffer/bytebuf.html#writebytes(java.io.inputstream %20int)     the documentation shows how to create a new  :  http://netty.io/4.0/api/io/netty/buffer/unpooled.html   
 you can created a mappedbytebuf from a filechannel and wrap it in bytebuffer via unpooled.wrappedbuffer(..).  
  does dispatcherservlet construct empty model object and pass to handler method getuserhistory?     partially yes  an empty model gets constructed  and its passed to the method getuserhistory. but its not really done by the dispatcherservlet  rather an implementation of  handlermethodargumentresolver  (in the particular case a modelmethodprocessor class). when the matching of the method is done  before the method is actually called another process takes place  that is  argument resolving . the signature of the matched method is inspected  and objects of certain types known to spring get automatically resolved and injected by spring. the types are defined in the docs   http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-ann-methods  check the list under subtitle supported method argument types. all of the listed types  have a registered  handlermethodargumentresolver  implementation that guides the creation of these objects     is dispatcherservlet doing this or some other interceptor?     picking up with the first answer  you can register your custom argument resolver. this  great blog article  tells you all you need to know to implement one. note that  userdetail  by what you have described could also be a form-backing bean  whose values are bound to the values of the input fields of the submitted form  here's an example  http://www.codejava.net/frameworks/spring/spring-mvc-form-handling-tutorial-and-example   
 you can  retrieve the public key from the certificate instead . key stores can be used to store the private key / certificate you hold yourself  or a trusted certificate of another entity. java (and android) key stores are mainly targeted at x5.09 based pki. storing a public key with a certificate does not make sense  the public key is already contained within the certificate.    so instead try:       
 it will work if you change to this:         that is  in the loop condition instead of:         you need one more condition:         this is because after you set    the loop moves forward and executes    and then in the next iteration the loop condition   throws a nullpointerexception because   is  .  
 you put a reference to your   into the  . if you want to add values from your   to the table  you have to iterate over the elements in the list.       
 java deals with object reference  if you need to copy the object  you need to consider  cloning  (a.k.a deep copy).    also  favour  interfaces over implementations   so use   instead of  .

 i use spring so we resolve it by           but i got a other exception          so i will ask a new question.  
 this is covered in section  8.3.3 of the jls :        use of class variables whose declarations appear textually after the use is sometimes restricted  even though these class variables are in scope (§6.3). specifically  it is a compile-time error if all of the following are true:             the declaration of a class variable in a class or interface c appears textually after a use of the class variable;       the use is a simple name in either a class variable initializer of c or a static initializer of c;       the use is not on the left hand side of an assignment;       c is the innermost class or interface enclosing the use.           in your case  all of them  are  true when you're printing the value  hence the error.    after changing your code to move the declaration  the first bullet is no longer true  so it compiles.  
 in case1  you are initializing the variable   with   and at line 2 with  . so end result is that variable   holds  .       in case 2 you will get   because you are trying to use the variable   before it is defined.  updated  as per  jls  static variables that are not yet defined can only be used in the assignment unless they are prefixed with class name(in which case they get there default value). e.g.1          e.g.2 in this case you are accessing variable   prefixed with class name. but remember that   will have value   not    so the output will be                in case 3  first you declared and initialize   and then assigned 3 to it. so after initialization   will hold 3 as its value  
 try this (with capital d) :       
 hierarchical clustering will not work well with mapreduce  ever .    first of all  mapreduce is  designed  to process one record at a time  whereas distance computations  do  need at least two records at a time. hacking distance based algorithms into mapreduce usually is a bad idea for this very reason; and this is why mapreduce is pretty much yesterdays news now. nobody focuses on mapreduce anymore  it is too limited for anything except preprocessing and filtering.    furthermore  it will not help much. the reason why hierarchical clustering scales inherently bad is that it requires   memory and   runtime in the usual implementation. so any gains obtained by a distributed implementation will only allow you to process a marginally larger data set: if you add 8 times as many computers  you can only process a 2 times larger data set. this is clearly unsatisfactory for scalability. plus  you will also need a lot more diskspace. do you really expect to have   disk space available?    last but not least  if you really have big data   you will not be able to look at the dendrogram anyway .     if you have big data  use a different algorithm. or sampling.     if your data isn't that large  just use a single-host implementation like  elki   which is reasonably fast. most likely  it will outperform a cluster-based implementation because it can avoid all the extra disk-io you get with mapreduce.  
 your code doesn't seem to add up in multiple places.       your first code block  apart from missing important bits  couldn't possibly work across multiple requests.        looks like it'll almost always be empty       a session-aware jax-ws service by itself wouldn't help you. the session  by definition is relating to a single user. without extra legwork on your part  there's no way for one user's webservice session to be shared across multiple users          the one glaring gap in your code is that  you're not identifying  an instance of the game  .  when a player requests to connect  they should be requesting to either connect to an existing game or to create one  by passing a   . without a token identifying a specific game  you'll struggle to connect multiple users to the same game.   should have the (overly simplistic) signature  . a list of   can be managed by a dao  outside of the context of the webservice endpoint. this way  returning players or new players can make their presence known by presenting a known    and you can keep track of connected users to a specific     
 the right answer for this project and solution is from  this document :       
     when my jscrollpane should expand in \"negative directions\" so upwards or to the left      you can't have negative coordinates  so you need to translate all the indexes to positive values.        and if not  i resize the jpanel.      this is the key. you need to override the   method of your custom panel to return the appropriate size of the panel after all nodes have been translated to positive values.    then you invoke:         on the panel to make sure the layout manager is invoked and the nodes are repainted.  
 both of your threads are trying to write to system.out. since  writing to printstream is synchronized   at every time one of your threads is writing to the stream and another is waiting for the stream to become available.    you would be able to see threads executing at the same time if they performed some activity that does not depend on a shared resource (for example  some computation).  
 you can use simpledateformat to parse string representing   e.g.         if you want date to be converted into string   then specify this format to  simpledateformat  like this       
 i would look into  making ajax applications crawlable  and  a proposal for making ajax crawlable     in a nutshell these are the steps you should consider:      crawlers maps from pretty url to ugly url. i.e from  http://examplegwtapp.com/app.html#view?hash=xyz  to  http://examplegwtapp.com/app.html?_escaped_fragment_=hash=xyz    crawler requests the ugly url   server maps from ugly url to pretty url. you can do this by identifying on the apache level any _escaped_fragment_ request and redirect it to a certain server controller to handle the crawler call. i.e. check  apache rewrite condition for ajax crawling    server invokes headless browser(htmlunit or if just small portion of your code is js just generate the static html with your server code. i.e  htmlunit generate page for gwt app    headless browser response returned to the crawler.    
 because the java language specification says so.  section 5.6.1  defines unary numeric promotion for evaulation of certain operators  and it says:            if the operand is of compile-time type byte  short  or char  it is promoted to a value of type int by a widening primitive conversion (§5.1.2).           section 5.6.2  on evaluation of binary numeric operators ('binary' meaning operators that have two operands  like '+') says something similar:            if either operand is of type double  the other is converted to double.     otherwise  if either operand is of type float  the other is converted to float.     otherwise  if either operand is of type long  the other is converted to long.     otherwise  both operands are converted to type int.          why was it defined this way? a major reason is that at the time of design of the java language and java virtual machine  32-bit was the standard word size of computers  where there is no performance advantage to doing basic arithmetic with smaller types. the java virtual machine was designed to take advantage of this  by using 32-bit as the int size  and then providing dedicated instructions in  the java bytecode  for arithmetic with ints  longs  floats  and doubles  but not with any of the smaller numeric types (byte  short  and char). eliminating the smaller types makes the bytecode simpler  and lets the complete instruction set  with room for future expansion  still fit the opcode in a single byte. similarly  the jvm was designed with a bias towards easy implementation on 32-bit systems  in the layout of data in classes and in the stack  where 64-bit types (doubles and longs) take two slots and all other types (32-bit or smaller) take one slot.    so  the smaller types were generally treated as second-class citizens in the design of java  converted to ints at various steps  because that simplified some things. the smaller types are still important because they take less memory when packed together (e.g.  in arrays)  but they do not help when evaluating expressions.  
     as i show the auto completion menu the focus is given to that dialog.      to prevent focus from going to the popup window you can use:             i also want to be able to navigate the menu with the up/down arrows and the enter key      then you need to override the default actions provided by the text field. check out  key bindings  for more information.    you can also check out:  button highlighting using keyboard keys  where i just provided a simple example of implementing an action.  
 what is the point of doing something like this? this will only work for a single row.    what if you have two rows:    alice  switch    the minimum width of the column will be controlled by the \"w\" in the second row  which means you will always have extra space around the \"l\" in alice.    why don't you just use a jpanel with a boxlayout and then add multiple jlabels to the panel?    anyway  if you feel you still need a jtable then you can check out the  table column adjuster  which attempts to fit the text. the basic code would be:         also  make sure you use   to set the dimension to 0.  
 the issue is that you're using smart quotes instead of the actual quote character.    here's a 'fixed' version of your code:         note the difference between   and  .      to fix this (and it depends on your keyboard  i think)  you should be using the   character that's immediately to the left of your   key.  
 i don't know if this is really the answer you're looking for  but i was just playing around with the idea and implemented something.     the jax-rs 2 spec defines a model for bean validation  so i thought maybe you could tap into that. all bad validations will get mapped to a 400. you stated  \"i'd prefer to prevent this exception from bubbling all the way up and present my users with  for instance  a 400 bad request\"   but with bad validation you will get that anyway. so however you plan to handle validation exceptions (if at all)  you can do the same here.    basically i just created a constraint annotation to validate for a null value in the id field. you can define the id field's name in the annotation through the   annotation attribute  so you are not restricted to  . also this can be used for other objects too  so you don't have to repeatedly check the value  as you suggested in your second solution.     you can play around with it. just thought i'd throw this option out there.          usage:         note the default   is    so if you don't specify it  it will look for the   field in the object class. you can also specify the   as you would any other constraint annotation:       
 the solution: it is settable in context file:         the \"jmsconfig bean \"\"diasblereplayto\" property solve the problem.  
 enums in java are    which means you cannot extend and enum (you cannot add more values to existing enum). in you case the   and   are completely different entities with simple the same names of enum items. this implicates for example that  .    there are many ways to handle that  however none of them is perfect or simple. you should evaulate what is needed in your specific case.     first way to handle that is to create a common interface  which your enums can extend:         this way you can use both   and   in  :         other approach is to add generics to your class. this way you can create concrete implementations which will support specified enum:         third way is to create multiple methods  one for each enum which need to be handled         see  this thread  for more ideas how to solve enum inheritance.  
 even though you have mentioned in same name it doesnt mean same in enum.  for example a in   is instance of abc. but a in   is instance of def. so its different. you can  implement interface in enum.         you will try this.  
 you can't extend enums but you can do the next best thing by simulating the behaviour of an enum. you can create a class with static value. like this.       
   have nothing to do with  .      means a member (be it a data member or a method) belongs to the  class   and not to a specific  instance .      just control what other classes can access these members  be it instance members or   members.  
 consider   and   below:         and          you can create as many instances of   and   as you like. however  the   is treated differently by the two classes due to the   keyword:       in case of      is a  class variable   mening that there will only be a single reference to an instance of  . note  that depending on the implementation of   you may or may not have to instantiate   at all  and yet there is a reference to the  .   in case of      is an instance variable meaning that each instance of   will always have a reference to an instance of a  . however  these references do not exist unless   is instantiated.      i suggest that you read up on  understanding class members  in the official java tutorial. from the very first line:        the   keyword to create fields and methods that belong to the class  rather than to an instance of the class.    
 to answer the difference  consider this example:         now if i do like:         how many instance you see of rect and how many rect1? you could have rect1 associated with each and every object while you will have just one instance of rect and being shared by every class.  
 first to undestand difference   assume this like written in some class foo          it means rect is member of foo class   which being private cannot be access from some other class. and being static  you don't need to create object and will be share across all the instances of foo.         it means rect can be accessed from any other class by creating instance of foo.    when we static is not associate with any object   it means you need not to create object for accessin static variable and its shared amoung all the the instances. however  private/public/proctected is related to visibility from other classes.  
 this is because of how string literals are defined in java. a backslash is used for some escape sequences (such as      and others)  therefore a literal backslash is also an escape sequence ( ).    back to your code however  don't bother  use  java.nio.file  instead:         works for every os the jvm (7+) runs on.    it will correctly return a   for   on your machine the same way it returns one for   on mine.  
 because  with a string    is an  escape  character: it says to interpret the following character in a special way (which is why   isn't an  ).  in your case  you want   itself to be interpretted specailly by  not  treating it special  so you need 2 of them: the first says \"treat the next character special\"  the next gets treated specially  for a   .  
 in the snippet you post  set the command1 var for example to        
 take a look at this one over  here . this guy implements it very nice. however i would not suggest working with actionbar tabs because if you want to upgrade your app to later versions this method is deprecated. so you dont use the actionbar and you can use the following if you would like          the adapter:           the fragment  that you will return and implementation of the   method:       
 let me guess: you don't want to process the same file on the second server to avoid that error. for this purpose you should use     as a reference to the   of the  . consider to use some out-of-the-box   or implement your own one.  
 as requested by op     in the last step while creating your avd  go to  advance settings  and select appropriate  skin  to make sure your it comes with resolution that you want.            
 problem is you declared instance variable   but you never assign anything to it  so it stays (auto)initialized with  . inside the while loop you declare a local varibale   and it is used for storing data retrieved from database. after while loop ends  local varibale    is not more. in   method you print the result of   method what is   stored in the instance variable  . your problem is known as  variable shadowing .      change   to      delete declaration     make   method return        repaired code:       
 you can download the android sdk and plug it into your existing version of eclipse. before android development studio i did this and it worked fine.     http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html     and here is a good tutorial for setting up android sdk on an existing eclipse:     http://www.ryanchapin.com/fv-b-4-740/setting-up-android-sdk-and-plugin-in-an-existing-install-of-eclipse.html   
 if you are new to android and want to start android development i suggest that you use android studio. it is an ide that is based on intellij idea. you can either download the  android studio ide  or download the  intellij idea and use the android plugin .    eclipse is not recommended any more because  android studio is the new offical ide .    you want to develop java and android using one ide. so i recommend that you use the  intellij idea  with the android plugin.     it is also useful to read the faq of jetbrains about android studio.   
 you dont need recursion for this .it is pretty straightforward.also notice the way i have created a 2d array         would this work ?  
 you have defined just 1d array and its number so you should use int.     instead of doing it recursively  try solving it easily with two for loops (1 for row and 1 for column) for 2d array as below:       
 you can create a function and pass it the value that you want to replace. it will be better then recursion because you can avoid extra cost of   that will be required during each recursive call         then you can call it like this       
 why do you think you need recursion? you could just iterate over the array and multiply every element by two (since   is   anyway  and it's faster than having to check the element):       
 ok  so if you want to change value of the connected component you start out in this should work.          note that depending of how big your components are you might run out of stack. either you'd then have to manage your own stack explicitly in the code or you would need to increase the stack space available to the jvm.  
 if you are using java 8 the  arrays.parallelsetall  method could be used.         it uses the java 8 stream api:s and offers a quite nice compact programming model. furthermore  it uses the  forkjoinpool  so performance  could  be better since it may be multi-threaded (depending on the cpu etc).  
 the statement is only true for top-level (non-nested) classes.  nested classes may be  .  that's because top-level classes have visibility into private nested classes (including the private members of a nested class)  and vice versa.  they may also be    meaning subclasses of the  enclosing  class  even in another package  can reference them.    note that this isn't unique to java files that declare more than one top-level class.   and   are not allowed on any top-level class declaration.  
 the persistencemanager has a fetchplan. a fetchplan has a maximum \"fetch depth\" which you can set following this link  http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform_4_0/jdo/fetchgroup.html   
 it repopulates the userrolerelationship after saving.     as you don't have a @fetch annotation on neither the start nor end-node it only loads them in a shallow fashion.     i don't recommend to add @fetch there because it can easily load your whole graph  so i'd probably use       
   is returning null (which it is  documented  as being allowed to do).    (the problem can't be that   itself is null  because you check that  and because you wouldn't even get into the   function if it was. so you must be passing a null to the function. and it sure isn't  .)  
 you need to split these as follows:       
 in your question there are two different operations on a table  you are trying to create and insert data in single query even in a wrong way. first you need to create table then insert data into created table. like below syntax.         after creation of table now you can insert data into table. like  below syntax.       
 i was able to resolve the issue by changing the intercept-url pattern from /images/* to /images/** .  this allowed the images that were stored under /images/cbf or /images/cbf/button to not go through the spring security filters.    
 i think you should use  viewpager  from the support library v4 rather than this custom horizontal scroll view in this case. it's designed for that purpose.    here is how to use it  https://developer.android.com/training/animation/screen-slide.html .  
 the problem was resolved with use gravity = gravity.fill_horizontal | gravity.center_vertical  that i set programmatically on a image view (method imageutils.scaleimage).  
 well even in functional programming  exceptions are not considered as return values.    take for instance  this segment of sml code:         as you can see  when the exception is raised  we forget about the original return type of the function (a list). it is in this moment that an error situation has happened in your application and you want to handle it to avoid your application from crashing. so  you would not be breaking the purity of your functional programming  since exceptions are thrown  not returned  in order to handle the instability caused by unexpected values/behavior inside your application.  
 don't both log and rethrow  if you feel like you want to put some information down and rethrow then wrap the exception. log only if you are done dealing with this exception and plan on returning a value from the method. not some error indication like in c  actual value. for example you tried to download something but failed  however you still have a fallback. if you are trying to indicate an error you throw an exception.    just to add  a lot of times people deal with exceptions by logging in place and returning a null. in the vast majority of cases this is the wrong thing to do as it will only lead to frustration of dealing with npes in completely different places  
 as you are already using an stl importer from this  site   you will find in the same web a  3d model browser  you can use to preview your models before importing them to your javafx application.    if they can't be imported with this browser  the problem may be related to a non valid stl format in your files.    if they are imported  then the problem may be in your application. embed the call in a try-catch and post the exception you may enconter.          edit     if no exception is thrown while reading the model  the next step would be inserting the returned mesh into a   and show it on our scene:         since the model could be too small or too big for our scene (related to the camera and the point of view we are using)  we should print the bounding box of our model  and then scale it up or down accordingly:         or we could change the camera parameters:       
 it seems easier to break this into three calls         if you absolutely wanted to put this into a single call  something like         could also work.  
 if you insist on a one-liner here is a possibility:         (yeah  not technically a one-liner  but one statement).    the idea: build the format string based on whether or not a given string is null. the   is there to get rid of the initial space before   or   in case   was null.  
 frankly this is a common weakness of all docker orchestration systems out there (afaik). google container engine  has the  persistent disk  feature so that volumes can be created that are persistent across container restarts. however  each persistent disk should only be attached to containers that are designed to run on a single instance. which defeats the purpose of a distributed environment.     amazon has a similar setup for docker on elastic-bean-stalk where you can mount ebs volumes onto an instance but again it does not play nice with the concept of docker volumes.      coreos  uses etcd for for this purpose by providing a shared key-value store between all clusters. this is not really as useful as a distributed file system but you can at least share some data between containers.     the point is given the state of affairs right now if you want shared data between containers you will have to roll your own solution.     edit: running the container in privileged mode i was able to mount and s3 bucket into the ocntainer using s3fs so this can be one option for rolling your own solution. although i would not use this for write heavy workloads.       
 instead of pass activity instance as parameter  you can use application's context method  which doesn't violate single responsibility principle.       
 the following is what i'd use  as you also wouldn't unnecessarily call a put if the list is already in your map:         note  i find this much more readable than using the ternary operator (less lines of code is not necessarily simpler  imho). and depending on the size of your maps  saving on unnecessary calls (the get and put) may not be trivial.   
 investigating the bytecode learns that the get() method is actually called twice in your second code snippet. in theory it's possible that the map would change between the calls so this can't be optimized.    on a side note: your call map.put() is redundant  because by modifying the object you will automatically change the stored object in the map. you're not pulling a copy from the map  you're pulling a reference to the object from the map.  
 why not passing the map.get(key) in a variable and then use it with ternary operator?    you could do:       
 yes there are a few rules about that  nothing written in stone  just kind of practices which became accepted best practices by experience and imitation.    overview      make the responsibility clear.   use camel case.   name objects  not classes.   use nouns.   avoid words like      or  .   use singular if there are objects.   use plural for utility classes.   prefix abstract base class with  .   suffix hidden implementation class with  .   do not prefix   names with  .   use design pattern names correctly.   prefix names with their specialization.   use data structure names correctly      details    make the responsibility clear    it's important that the name reflects the responsibility nicely. the name shall communicate its intent.    name objects  not classes    use a name which looks good when using a single object. name the object  not the class.    use camel case    usecamelcasefornamesoftypesinjava.    use nouns    use nouns for objects. if the object represents an action  turn the verb into a noun. if the object represents an attribute  turn the adjective into a noun. for example  if the action is    use   if it is an active action  or   if it is a passive ability. if the action is    use   if it is an active action    if it is a passive ability.    avoid words like      or      in most of the cases  they're just synonyms for \"i don't know what to call this\" (robert c. martin). this itself is a symptom of \"i don't know what this thing is doing\" or \"this thing is doing more than one thing\". which is why we often rightfully feel the urge to refactor when we see such names.    use singular if there are objects    class names usually are singular  especially if you can obtain multiple objects of a single class. we like to reserve the plural for variable names of collections of such objects.    good example         bad example      is a bad class name because it is plural although there are objects. we like to call a    . so  how do you call a   -  ?  ?  ???    use plural for utility classes    a class is a utility class if it contains only static methods which exist for the sole purpose to provide utility methods for another type.    good examples                       .    prefix abstract base class with      an abstract base implementation for an interface   is usually called  .    examples:            and so forth.    make sure that this name is a name the user would hardly ever see    is a nice name for the implementor / extensor  not for the user. and only choose this name in the absence of a better name.    suffix hidden implementation class with      a class which provides the default implementation for an interface or abstract class   is sometimes just called  .    make sure the user never sees this name. never ever. it's only good for the implementor  nobody else. a name like   must not be visible to the user. and only choose this name in the absence of a better name.    do not prefix   names with      the purpose of a type in an oo language usually is to encapsulate and hide things. whether a type is a    an    an   or an   annotation is a detail of that type. there are only two situations where you need to know these details about a type: when you want to extend the type  and when you want to create an object of that type. these use cases are the minority of the use cases of types. by prefixing interface names with    you violate this principle by loudly declaring an implementation detail that in fact should be hidden.    putting an   in front of the names of  s is like using hungarian notation. hungarian notation only makes sense when you're working in an environment where keeping track of these physical aspects of your types is essential. (and for that matter it even is not necessary in c these days!)    besides  you don't want to look like an idiot when      you decide to change a class in an interface or vice versa and do not rename the type  you end up with an interface without  -prefix or a class with  -prefix.   you decide to change a class in an interface or vice versa and rename the type  you end up annoying your users.   oracle removes the differences between   and   in a future version of java (not so unlikely  look at how interfaces have static and default methods now).   you port your api to another language which doesn't distinguish between   and   and now have classes with   prefix  or classes which have different names.      use design pattern names correctly    if you use a design pattern  you may use its name if it seems appropriate. but if you do not use a design pattern  avoid names of design patterns.    it's optional to use a design pattern name when using a design pattern - use it if it helps or is common practice to use the name of the design pattern  like the  -suffix for abstract factories.    but it's almost mandatory to avoid a design pattern name when you're actually not using it. it might be confusing if you name something   but it doesn't implement the  command pattern   if you name something   but it doesn't implement the  strategy pattern   if you name something   but it doesn't implement the  factory pattern .    it's not always confusing  some judgement might be required. for example  you might have a framework for writing command line programs with an interface and an abstract base class for these command line programs. you might want to call them   and   despite the fact that this is not really the  command design pattern   at least not from the perspective of the language itself.    examples where the name is used         factory  design pattern      builder  design pattern      command  design pattern (aka  action    transaction )      examples where the name is not used           -  command  design pattern but different  more specialized names.     -  factory method  for a  decorator       prefix names with their specialization    it is common for class names to grow as we advance downwards in the inheritance tree by prefixing the name of a base class with information about the specialization.    examples       :               :              use data structure names correctly    if you implement data structures  use the appropriate names.    the concept of having key/value pairs regardless of how they are maintained is called  dictionary   so an interface describing that should be named  dictionary . (the reason that java named it  map  instead was that the original collections in java 1.0 were purely designed and already used an abstract class    so the   needed a new name.)    your case    in your case  i could imagine the following design:        for everything that can be executed.     for something to which commands can be submitted.          i could update this section in case you give a little bit more details. for something which queues and processes commands you might also want to think about parallelization and have a look at  .  
 from the way you describe your model it looks like you are dealing with something very close to a composition pattern (cm is the root command  while c represents individual commands.) if this is the case  then the names you are trying to find are:         in other words  what you've called   would play the role of    your current   class would be   and  finally  the (abstract) superclass your are looking for would be   in the terminology i'm proposing. both the root as well as any other nested commands would be instances of  . of course  if the root has some special behavior you could also model this as:         this way    would take the place of your    it would be composite in itself and any other command with subcommands will be of class    while \"leaves\" would be of class  .    i know  some people will dislike concrete classes with subclasses. if that is your case you should do something like this:         now   and   are abstract and all three concrete classes are subclass free.    you might still be wondering why i'm using so many names and not  . it is because  in my opinition  there is no such thing as a command  manager .     finally  you might need another object (from a different hierarchy)  say    that would provide parsing services in a more abstract way. the   hierarchy would use the services of the parser and add semantics to otherwise abstract tokens. it is very likely that this separation will bring more simplicity to the   code. at the same time it would decouple the syntax of your command language from the internal representation  which would add more flexibility to your design because you could offer  say  two different syntaxes without having to modify the   hierarchy.  
 try something like this (is an aproximation)  with linelistener to detect the end of playing:       
 your understanding is right. spring aop is proxy-based. spring uses either jdk proxies (preferred wheneven the proxied target implements at least one interface) or cglib proxies (if the target object does not implement any interfaces) to create the proxy for a given target bean.    unless configured to do otherwise  spring aop performs run-time weaving. you can however set up spring to do load-time weaving through aspectj. check the  documentation link  for more details.    reference for  spring aop proxying internals

     the frame is not set to be visible before the insets values are calculated  so they are all 0 (zero)  am i getting it right?      correct  components do not have a size until the frame has been    which means the native objects on the os you are running on have been created. this is done when you   the frame or make the frame visible.    if you are trying to make the panel that contains the label a size of (300  125) then the easier approach would be to do:         now the pack() method will determine the size of the frame based on the preferred size of all the components added to the frame. no need to worry about insets.    note: as a general rule you should not invoke setpreferredsize() on a component  since each component is responsible for determining its own size.

 spring mvc will not allow you to override method annotated with @requestmapping  or more exactly it does not allow you to annotate the overriding method with @requestmapping and will use the mapping in base class.    but you can always define 2 methods in base class : one annotated with @requestmapping that only delegates to second not annotated. then you are then free to override the second method in subclasses. example :    abstract base class for a crud controller         concrete implementation for class processq         example is taken from a real program  that's the reason why you can see elements for pagination  error processing and access to underlying request.

 create a handlerinterceptor (extend  handlerinterceptoradapter ) and get the accept-language header from the request. you need to register your interceptor in your web application context config.    you also want to know what domain your server is running on. see  how to get domain url and application name?      you should allow the user to change their locale (they might want your site in german even if browser is set to en_us). so you'd need to set a cookie in this case. see  localechangeinterceptor  too.   
 what about something like this in your controller:         note that language codes are written in lowercase.  
 see  jar documentation     -c option changes to the specified directory and adds the next file to the jar.    example:    jar cf imageaudio.jar -c images . -c audio .    the -c images part of this command directs the jar tool to go to the images directory  and the . following -c images directs the jar tool to archive all the contents of that directory. the -c audio . part of the command then does the same with the audio directory.     so  in your example  you will add to the jar the content of folder1/folder2/folder3 directory.  
 according to this  post  this type of error occurs when you are inserting into a table which has more columns then you provide values for; if that happens  you must reference them in parentheses by name:         i assume maybe you also have an id which you don't insert and is not automatically generated? or some other columns?    also  as a suggestion  in the insert statement you didn't need to write all those variables by hand  you could have used the references you made above  like for example replace  l1.gettext() with pnr and so on. (this is not causing the error  but since you just wrote them  it would be better to use them).    the code would look something like:         this  considering that the table's columns are called the way you called the variables earlier.     it is important that you put all the information in the format code i wrote earlier  and that should do the trick  i don't know exactly what your column names and variables containing the values are.  
   can end up calling itself with an empty string. when that happens  the first line with give an   in  .    p.s. on closer inspection  the bounds in the   calls are also incorrect: since the end index is  exclusive   the second argument should be  . you'll need to fix that too.  
 try this:       
 your substring is wrong. you are removing an extra character from the end.       
 there are several problems here:      as noted  the   call is wrong - the   is exclusive  so you should end at     you are calling    and then moving on with the function  eventually returning   - instead  you should  return  the result of   applied on the substring:      so  after taking both these mistakes in to considetation  the method should read as follows:       
     is there a way to make a switch using class.getsimplename() without having to hardcode the class names?      no. basically  calling   doesn't count as a compile-time constant expression  so it can't be used as a case statement. it would be nice if there were a   operator as there will be in c# 6  but without that  i don't think you'll be able to use a switch/case without hard-coding the names.  
 redirect is a http response sent to the browser requesting it to submit a new request to the specified url. since it results in issuing an entirely new request previous request attributes you set wont be available in the new request.     in terms of forwarding to a servlet  did you check your web.xml configuration. is it setup so that the forwarded servlet is seeing forwarded requests ?    you could save the attribute to the session in the first servlet and access it from the second. use  http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/httpservletrequest.html#getsession()     also you could pass the attribute value in the url query string in the redirect. so your redirect url would look like 'myredirecturl?attributename=attributevalue'    also additionally try using 'include' method rather than 'forward'.   
 the problem with your code is that the fields (not shown) obviously are    as can be told from your constructor:         the constructor should instead read like this:         a field which is static exists only once per class. a field which is not static exists once per each object constructed from that class (or any subclass). because of that  you actually created objects which are empty  and whatever you thought you would store in the object you actually stored in the class  thus sharing the same data among all objects.    as a rule of thumb  you usually do not want any   non-  fields in your classes. exceptions apply  but they're rare and mostly limited to a few tiny bootstrapping things in frameworks.  
 you have a foreign key defined between parent_entity_id and id. set it to allow cascading deletes: deleting a parent will delete all it's children  and all their children et cetera.    be sure you actually want this to happen!  
 have a look at libraries like google guava       
 this is a possible duplicate of  java: function for arrays like php&#39;s join()?     don't reinvent the wheel! this has been done many many times  unit tested and maintained. so use them  don't make your own.    you can use  apache commons   stringutils  and use the  join  method on  iterable  (which  vector  is)         also  as pointed out by tom in the comments of your question  in java 8 you can use      
 since you're using a    it's easier to just delete the last comma:       
 i would go with the  string.join  approach.         a nice and clean solution. only available for java 8.  
 simply use        
 change your loop as below:         internally vector uses array and you are accessing element by index now instead of using advance for each loop.  
 there are several third party libraries that do the heavy lifting for you  like  apache commons lang 's  stringutils :         if you absolutely must do this yourself  i'd start with the first element and append a comma and an element for each succeeding element:       
 your 2nd option won't work  since it would cause your lists to contain duplicates. if you add an element to a list that already contains that element  it will now contain that element twice. and if later you try to remove that element from that list using    you'll only remove one of the two occurences of the element  so the list would still contain that element.    that second option can only work with  s.  
 you could consider using arraylist with size 3 and define it like:         and you could use contains method like:

 this is not going to be a full answer as i'm not exactly sure about the tools you are using to compile the web service  but anyway  here goes:    basically  a connection is something that is only valid on a particular machine. if it's a tcp/ip connection  it consists of two pairs: source host and port  and target host and port. if it's a linux socket  then it is an entry in that particular machine's directory tree.    a database connection is usually built on one of those constructs  so it  too  is particular to a machine.    therefore  it doesn't make sense to pass a   object to the user who calls your method from some remote machine. and since it doesn't make sense  the jax-rpc standard does not include a serialization for    and that's why it fails.    your problem is that you have designed your method such that it accepts a connection as a parameter  and uses that connection to access the database. this works ok locally  but is not a good design for a remote service.    instead  your method should acquire the connection internally. the remote user should access just the   method  with the name of the table  and   should call    use the connection  and the close it.    you shouldn't have a main method in a web service. and the   method should be changed from   to    so that   can access it. when it is private  i believe the web service compiler will not complain about it because it doesn't have to create a serialization for it.

 are you trying to use the test itself as a part of the spring configuration? that's not going to work. what you need to do is:  - remove the   and   annotations from the test itself - create a simple   class:          and just reference that in your test:          and you should be able to inject your service just fine.     hope it helps.   
 if the   is the content of an mp4 file  you could simply save the input stream to a file. that's your mp4 .         hope it help :) thanks  
 correct annotation is   not @transaction  
 here is an example of private interfaces.         from within the class   you can refer to an   and call   on it. therefore you can have a   of  s of different types and use a for each loop to call   on them all.     however  outside the class   this is not possible. you can have a   or a   and call   on either  but the interface   and the interface method   are invisible.  
 the examples in the linked article are a bit contrived and artificial (as already indicated by the odd names       etc...). however  let's focus on the part of the quote that your question refers to:         \"...without adding any type information (that is  without allowing any upcasting).\"       the class may offer multiple (public or private) implementations of this interface. but the key point is:      nobody will ever be able to figure out that they implement this interface .     simply  because the interface is not public.     i tried to create an example showing a possible application case. of course  it is still contrived  but may make the point more obvious. consider you want to model a   data structure  which consists of   objects. these can be   objects (which have child nodes) or   objects (which have no children).    such a class could be implemented like this:         in an external   method  you can observe the limitations imposed by the private interface:         in this example  you can call    passing in the   that is returned by    regardless of whether this node is a   or a  . in the current version  this will print something like         if you changed   to return a    then it would only print            to put it simply  and as the name \"private interface\" already suggests: you can use this in order to  hide  the fact that two classes share a common ancestor.   
 i have investigated in to this issue and able to find some  more  information.  the following is a practical example         the saveinterface class is a type (i.e. a class with no implementation  all its methods are abstract). it has one public member function called savedata(). the document class from the initial solution now implements the saveinterface type in a manner which keeps the savedata() method from being accessible to clients of document.     notice that  in this solution  savehandler does not have a navigable association with the document class. this has been replaced with a navigable association to the saveinterface class. since savedata() is declared publicly in the saveinterface class savehandler no need to be declared as a friend of the document class.    since the savehandler class is not a friend of the document class it does ot have the ability to change any of its private member variables or call any of its private member functions. so the encapsulation of the document class has been preserved. the savehandler class no longer even needs to know about the document class since it now depends on an interface called saveinterface. this reduces the overall dependencies in the design and creates a potential for reuse.    participants     target (document)       defines the public interface for the client.    constructs the requesthandler (savehandler) object and passes to the requesthandler an instance of the requestinterface (saveinterface) class. ? in the motivating example  the document class exports an interface that allows clients to start asynchronous saves.       client       clients use the exported target interface to perform specific functions.       command       the command interface is employed because it is likely that the target interface will want to create many different kinds of requesthandler objects. if all of these objects implement the command interface then a factory2  could be used to create the individual requesthandler objects.       requesthandler (savehandler)        created with a reference to the requestinterface. implements the command interface so the target class can call the execute() member function to perform the request.     in the motivating example  the savehandler class is used to create a separate thread of execution and then call a member function defined in the saveinterface to actually save the data in the document in the ewly created thread.        requestinterface (saveinterface)       specifies an abstract interface for a particular request.            known uses     this pattern is used extensively in an embedded real-time environment at xerox. it is employed in order to break the thread of execution in classes that perform various services for their clients.    for more info :  http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/privateinterface.pdf   
 a private interface is a way to force a class to implement some methods  without publicly exposing that this interface is implemented - e.g.  you won't be able to create a   and add instances of your class to it.  
 i think  the question is  why  you would want to \"force\" your own class implement anything? i mean  it's your class  if you want it to implement a method  just implement it. \"private interface\" is just a misnomer. an interface is the view of your class that you want to expose to outside. making it private serves no purpose whatsoever.    if you are asking about \"package private\" interfaces  that's kinda different  although not much. you might want sometimes to implement an interface  that is internal to your implementation and is not exposed to the outside. it is pretty hard (albeit  not impossible) to come up with an example where it would be useful though.  
 you probably use a connection pool in spring jdbctemplate.    if yes  your driver may use one connection to make the insert  but another different one for the last_insert_id query.    to force using the same connection  start a transaction before inserting  and commit it after the last_insert_id query.  
 try this;       
 i assume you need the various boolean properties to merge using or semantics. is that right?    if so  loop through your arrays and place the objects into a    where the key is the  . this will de-dupe the animal entries with the same type.     but before you put each value in  check if a value already exists and mutate the boolean properties accordingly.  
 leave it empty instead of passing null as parameter       
 i don't have an easy way to test hdfs but i just mounted s3fs inside a docker ubuntu container. s3fs also uses fuse so i hope it would have similar requirements. i had to run the container as -privileged to get it to work otherwise fuze mount the filesystem and would get the following error.      i am not sure if google allows you to run containers in privileged mode though so i don't know if this will work for you even if you could mount hdfs.  
  move your timer code and your action listener into the constructor:           try calling this method from the restart buttons onclick listener:        
  restructure your program such that your display code is independent from your game code     create another class  a gamedisplay  that holds your jframe and other swing components  and that manages mouse and keyboard events. in fact  it's best practice to create several classes to manage all this  but one is sufficient for this purpose. then  have your gamedisplay contain a game  and call the game's methods in response to events. once you have done that  you can restart the game simply by constructing a new game instance and having your gamedisplay begin using the new instance instead.  
 one approach to initialize the jframe from the same class:            }    you can add an action listener to the button in the first frame and inside the actionperformed method initialize another frame. thanks.  
 all you have to do is add an   to the    once clicked you can simply instantiate the new frame. something similar to this:            obviously whatever you want to do once the   occurs is entirely up to you. if you don't understand something  just ask.  
 a quick fix would be adding the   next to the public class.    the class usually recognizes the actionlistener as soon as you run it.  
 try this one. i run this code in netbeans and it works well.       
 it seems that if less input is supplied your code won't work.try using         or if that didn't work out well try changing your whole code to:         }  
 with that pattern  it will split on every \"-\"  but group 1 does not even exist because you use no groups in your regex.    what you want is easier done with    that is         the regex explained: 2 digits followed by a dash  then 3 word characters (afaik the short names for months are all 3 letters followed by another dash and the year in 4 digits.  
 you can try below code block. this will add line-break.       
 seeing that your format of date is dd-mon-yyyy  this is the regex i came up with: '[0123][\\d]-[jfmasond][aepuco][nbrylgptvc]-\\d\\d\\d\\d'    [0123][\\d] matches the date  which can have either 0 1 2 or 3 in the tens digit and in the ones place it can have any decimal    [jfmasond][aepuco][nbrylgptvc] matches the month  i have taken the alphabets from different month  first alphabet in caps rest two in small.    \\d\\d\\d\\d matches the years(0000-9999) hope this is clear. this regex works in python  have not tested in java but it should work fine.       
 no it wont repeat itself in the second half  but there might be multiple instances of equal objects     just computes the carthesian product a and a (i.e. all rows of a get joined with all rows of a) for example if table a contains only an id-column and has the values 1 2 3 the above mentioned query gives you the following         so    returns         so your query will retiurn at least all objects implementing named in your databse and possibly some duplicates if the same exists multiple times. with following database         your query gives you         so since two entries have the same name the first gets joined with itself and with the other one and the same is true for the second one  which means if you have n objects with the same name hibernate will retrive each object n times.

     would it be also okay to just add final to the getters and setters instead to prevent overriding those methods?      yes  it would. in addition to stopping the warning  it would make your code more robust  because subclasses would not be able to change the validation in your setters  either on purpose or by accident.    another solution would be to make a private method for validating the data  and call it from both the constructor and the setter. this would solve the problem as well:       
 assuming you know that 507 would appear before 504  you can use a boolean variable :       
 you can create a function that returns the index-distance between two values in an array or -1 if any of them is not present.         *this solution is agnostic regarding sorted or unsorted arrays    *supposing your array has unique values it works  else it only works for computing the distance between the first appearance of each value.  
 i've found a solution. it seems to be simple enough. just create new entity object  initialize its id and pass it as a parameter to jpql update query:         apparently jpa doesn't care whether that   object was retrieved from database or created manually  only   property must be set.  
 i believe the entitymanager.getreference() method exists just for this purpose. see  javadoc

    reason why you have synchronized just before your while loop is because of wait method as it needs to own the object's mutex before the call.  wait  method as per the java doc says:        the current thread must own this object's monitor. the thread releases ownership of this monitor and waits until another thread notifies threads waiting on this object's monitor to wake up either through a call to the notify method or the notifyall method. the thread then waits until it can re-obtain ownership of the monitor and resumes execution.       why your code works with synchronization and not without:    you might be accessing getter and setter method of same mythread's object from multiple threads where one thread would read the value of suspendflag while other might modify suspendflag the value which might not be visible to the other thread and hence can create race condition.     
 because the suspendflag will be accessed from multiple threads  so the access to the suspendflag must be sychronized  which means only one thread can access it at given moment.   
 in general  no  because the database server is a separate process than the process running your application.     perhaps  instead of the client-server configuration  you would be more comfortable with the embedded derby configuration  in which there is no separate server process to start or stop.     the limitation of the embedded configuration is that (a) your application is the only one that can be accessing the database at that time  and (b) your application must be on the same machine as the database.    here's some more information about the differences between the two configurations:  http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.11/getstart/cgsquck70629.html   
 this is how gc seperate variables' scope  so a variable in a class would be in s0 but when getting into a method gc is triggerd so that local variables in the method becomes s0 and the variables in the class becomes s1.  when getting out of the method  gc is triggerd again  the local variables are destroyed and the variables in the class are moved to s0 and when out of the class they are destroyed(note that variables in the class mean any variables we can reach not just static variables).  
 as far as you have   extended from     you can simply use   method to pass object to view. why not to use this useful feature ?          and in view you can get tag using   method.         of course you can declare method or constructor in your   class    like          if you have your   in another activity and you want to pass data to it  firstly you should pass it via intent   than get object from intent in second activity   and after that pass this object to your  . if you need an example  just say.  
 simply call view object and setcontentview         additionally if you want to pass   pass through creating   methods in your

 apache commons lang's   class is absolutely a good alternative to  . it's fast and also thread-safe ( especially usefull in multi-threaded server environments). all patterns are compatible with   (except time zones and some year patterns).    the summary of the constructor is :         you could find more info at   fastdateformat   
 the fastest implementation is very likely to be:         if performance is the most important thing  you should use that.        actually i don't want to use simpledateformat  since i believe its flexibility comes with too much overhead.      according to a quick  jmh  benchmark  on my laptop    gets twelve million ops/second and   is two million.    what's your budget? once you know that you'll be able to decide which of those is most appropriate.  
 try:         or:         not sure which one is faster though.    to format the date into a string  you can use simpledateformat:

 i don't understand why you do it manualy if you already have spring framework.    take a look at  mappingjackson2httpmessageconverter  and configure your servletdispatcher accordingly. spring will automatically convert your objects to json string and vice versa.    after that your controller method will be looked like:       
 i guess the reason is the lazy loading of the vaadin table. i experienced that on the first load the table is initialized with one row (for better response to the user i suppose)  after this it is re-initialized with the lazy-loading amount (in your case the whole table) this would explain the extra 8 calls.

 your symptoms are caused by this call:         the signature of   is:         so your values are:         with left being larger than right  your x-coordinate direction is right to left. and with bottom larger than top  the y-coordinate direction is top to bottom.    therefore  if you translate your geometry with positive coordinate values  it will move to the left and down. which is exactly what you're seeing.    if you want a more conventional coordinate system where x goes from left to right and y from bottom to top  your   call should look like this:       
 we can see from the dump that there are two threads of   that are stuck (might be deadlock).    most chances are that either the library that you're using is not releasing resources or there's a deadlock. an ugly workaround would be to use   as the last operation in   but personally i would rather find another (more stable) library that provides the same services.    there's also a chance that the issue you're facing is due to the fact that you're running the code from your ide (intellij). try running the same code from command-line and see if you can reproduce.

 if you know a particular entry exists  then fetching the entry before updating would fill the object with the existing values and you'd only change the values your json provided. this avoids null updates like you describe.    if  however  the entry is new  then whatever is missing in the json will be passed as null to the database.

     case 2:string object using new(). it creates 2 objects one in string constant pool and another one in heap area.      only if you create a new   object by passing it a string literal  like this:         the literal   will cause an object in the string constant pool to be created. the   will create a new   object on the heap  with a copy of the content of the object for the literal.    you should never create   object like that  because it's unnecessary and inefficient.    there are however other reasons why you would want to do    when the value that you pass to the constructor is not a string literal. for example  the value is data read from a file.  
     case 1: string object using string literal. it creates one object in string constant pool      correct.        if it is not present      wrong. it  is  present.        otherwise  return the reference of this object.      it  always  return the reference of the object. no 'otherwise' about it.        this object is implicitly interned.      not really. it is  already  interned   because  it is a string literal. the compiler and class loader see to that. not the  operator.        case 2:string object using new(). it creates 2 objects one in string constant pool      not really. it was already there: see above.        and another one in heap area.      correct.        reference variable refer to the heap area object.for this object we need to call intern method to put this object into string constant pool explicitly.      correct.        my question is if new() already creates one object in string constant pool      it doesn't. see above.

 if i will write \"import java.lang.integer;\" so its a particular find integer function only. if i will write \"import java.lang.integer.*; so its all function included which extension of \"java.lang.integer\".  
      the above statement is a less common form of    allows you to import the public nested classes of an enclosing class(in this case integer class).    consider for example  if the   class contained useful nested classes  such as   and    you could import rectangle and its nested classes by using the following two statements.         be aware that the second import statement will not import rectangle.  
 depends on where the time is spent.    if you have a load of calculations to do then allocating work to more threads can help  as you say each thread may execute on a separate cpu. in such a situation there is no value in having more threads than cpus. as corbin says you have to figure out how to split the work across the threads and have responsibility for starting the threads  waiting for completion and aggregating the results.    if  as in your case  you are waiting for a database then there can be additional value in using threads. a database can serve several requests in paraallel (the database server itself is multi-threaded) so instead of coding         where you wait for each response before issuing the next  you want to have several worker threads each performing         then you get better throughput. the trick though is not to have too many worker threads. several reasons for that:      each thread is uses some resources  it has it's own stack  its own connection to the database. you would not want 10 000 such threads.   each request uses resources on the server  each connection uses memory  each database server will only serve so many requests in parallel. you have no benefit in submitting thousands of simultaneous requests if it can only server tens of them in parallel. also if the database is shared  you probably  don't want to saturate the database with your requests  you need to be a \"good citizen\".      net: you will almost certainly get benefit by having a number of worker threads. the number of threads that helps will be determined by factors such as the number of cpus you have and the ratio between the amount of processing you do and the response time from the db. you can only really determine that by experiment  so make the number of threads configurable and investigate. start with say 5  then 10. keep your eye on the load on the db as you increase the number of threads.  
 in the described scenario  given that process is a time-consuming task  and given that the cpu has more than one core  multi-threading will indeed improve the performance.    the processor is not the one who allocates the threads. the processor is the one who provides the resources (virtual cpus / virtual processors) that can be used by threads by providing more than one execution unit / execution context. programs need to create multiple threads themselves in order to utilize multiple cpu cores at the same time.    the two major reasons for multi-threading are:      making use of multiple cpu cores which would otherwise be unused or at least not contribute to reducing the time it takes to solve a given problem - if the problem can be divided into subproblems which can be processed independently of each other (parallelization possible).   making the program act and react on multiple things at the same time (i.e. event thread vs. swing worker).      there are programming languages and execution environments in which threads will be created automatically in order to process problems that can be parallelized. java is not (yet) one of them  but since java 8 it's on a good way to that  and java 9 maybe will bring even more.    usually you do not want significantly more threads than the cpu provides cpu cores  for the simple reason that thread-switching and thread-synchronization is overhead that slows down.    the package   provides many classes that help with typical problems of multithreading. what you want is an   to which you assign the tasks that should be run and completed in parallel. the class   provides factor methods for creating popular types of  s. if your problem just needs to be solved in parallel  you might want to go for  . if your problem is urgent  you might want to go for  .    your code thus could look like this:         please note that the sequence in which the objects would be processed is no longer guaranteed if you go for this approach of multithreading.    if your   are something which can provide a parallel stream  you could also do this:         this will leave the decisions about how to handle the threads to the vm  which often will be better than implementing the multi-threading ourselves.    further reading:       http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/streams/parallelism.html#executing_streams_in_parallel     http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html     
 there are two side to a rest interaction  the client and the server. jersey/jax-rs-2 has both a client api and the \"main\" server side api. when working with the client api  we could use the    and when using the server side api  we would use the  . there's no possibility to mix and match these  they should strictly be used with the appropriate side of the interaction.    a   (server side) example would be to do some authorization/authentication  which a pretty common use case for server side filter. the filter will be invoked before reaching any of your resources         a   (client side) example would be implement some client side cache (sort of mocking a browser cache). or a a case (which already has been implemented) is a filter to encode a user name and password for basic authentication. before the request actually gets sent to the server  the client filter will get invoked.            there are also   that follow the following flow       
 i actually found the solution on my own. sorry for the lame question  as it was a focus issue. i just needed to call requestfocusinwindow().  
     my code works when i run the project from an ide or cmd.      so how are you doing this? i would guess you are using a keylistener. a keylistener only works when a component has focus and i would guess your buttons don't have focus so the code doesn't work. in general you should not use a keylistener swing was designed to be used with  key bindings .    so one way to solve this is to create a custom action for tabbing forward and backwards and then bind these actions to the panel containing the buttons. the   can work even when the component doesn't have focus. the code would be something like:         another way is to use the  keyboardfocusmanager . the   manages focus traversal. the default focus traversal keys are tab and shift-tab.     if you want to also use the arrow keys  then you need to add these keystrokes to the focus manager. so for each component you want to change you would do:         the first approach works for all components on a panel. the second approach for individual components.  
 try to set the mnemonic property of your button to the key you want.        
 jboss eap 6.3.0  quickstarts  use the following dependency:         i've used this one without problems         to be honest  i'm not so sure what is the difference between them.. but i'm confident either one will work.    hope it helps!  
 inside you deepcopy method you are again using arrays and objects. so  state and clonedstate is again referencin same object. if you don't want to do serailiaze and desearialze  then you need to create new object for each object and copy the primitive type.    instead of :-         you need to do :-         this you need to do recusively  if any  object is inside piecedetail only.    for more detail. you may go through  java: recommended solution for deep cloning/copying an instance   
 i don't have a windows machine to test this on  but generally to get the output for those builtins you run   as the program and pass it the command as an argument.    now  this has some limitations  because when the command finishes the executable stops.  so if you do a   command  it will work  but it only affect the subprocess  not your process. for those sorts of things  if you want them to change the state of your process  you'll need to use other facilities.    this version works on a mac:       
 you can split the string using   :       
      this will give you a string array with the numbers.   
 alternatively  you can use a stringtokenizer. (java.util)    this can be used if your string is delimited by more than one characters (can be be used as well in case of single character). your example using stringtokenizer       
 i would suggest to pass the json data in the body as a   request.but if you still want to pass this as a parameter in url you will have to encode your url like below just for example:-    for ex json is :->      2    for more information on url encoding refer below     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/percent-encoding   
 &amp; is an keyword for the next parameter like this ur?param1=1&amp;param2=2    so effectively you send a second param named r\". you should urlencode your string. isn't post an option?

  solution:       first  the answer of martin-g has given the right direktion. the properties-file have to be the same name like the application-class (\"wicketapplication.properties\").   second  very useful was to change the debuglevel in wicket (src\\main\\resources\\log4j2.xml) from level.info to level.debug. there was a many information about the url (path) which wicket has tried to loaded.     third  i make the way to access my properties-file shorter  because i delete isopropertiesfilepropertiesloader (iso-8859 formated properties-files) and xmlfilepropertiesloader in net.kog.wicketapplication.init(). code:            the full path of my utf-8 properties-file is src/main/webapp/net/kog/wicketapplication.properties  
 you need to link the other project to current project. follow the steps as:      right click on project where you need dependency project and select build path -> configure build path   select projects tab   click on add and select the other project   click on ok button      on the other hand  if there are dependencies i.e. third part jars included in project 1 and you want that to be automatically applied when added to current project  you need to do teh following:      right click on dependent project and select build path -> configure build path   click on order and export   click on select all button   click on ok    
 change your loop from         to         as in your earlier loop  x might have become 0 and you are trying to do like:         in your for loop  which is why it doesn't enter the for loop.  
 in the first loop  you are counting down from   to zero. in the second loop  the equivalent of   is  .    but instead of counting down from    you are counting down from    which gives you the incorrect result. so change that do:       
 change this         to

 since you are using the fragment classes from the support library  make sure your splash class is extending the support library's fragment class (android.support.v4.app.fragment). possibly you have imported android.app.fragment instead.  
 the error is in this line rs.getstring(\"count(*)\") so you can change this two line:         respectively in :         for velocity i think that you must init is so you can add this line:       
 i found what the problem was. it was not because of         here  what the stack track says          it is telling us to check the row position  which in this case is nothing.  the correct code then is         using a column alias is just nothing.  
 if you re-define a static member (either method or variable) in a sub-class  you are hiding the definition of the super-class.         here static   is redefined in the sub-class  but it doesn't override the   of the super class.    calling   would invoke  's  . if   didn't have a    calling   would have called  's  .  
 the variable in subclass hides the variable  with the same name  in the super class.  
 if you redefine static method in subclass  its called method hiding. static method are resolved at compile time rather than run time  and you call them based on class like say:         and you call as:       
 you can see for yourself with this          it pprints:    a.x=1 b.x=1 a.y=1 b.y=1 a.f() = 2 b.f() = 2 a.sf() = 1 b.sf() = 1    one would expect b.sf to be printed as 2 but no.    same one would expect b.x and b.y printed as 2 but also no because fields are also not polymorphic  only functions.    i'm not sure if this has much practical value  one surely learns that after having done an error. this is likely to be asked at worse job interviews though.

 there are many encryption/decryption algorithms such as data encryption standards (des)  playfair  etc.  etc. you may use those. and if you like  make your own algorithm. i once made a messenger app and i made my own algorithm for encryption/decryption.    you may also choose to have a symmetric or asymmetric key algorithm... keep working  messengers have a nice scope.. :)  
 as jared said - use rsa for key exchange and then a symmetric cipher for the communication itself. there are open source projects where you can dig an implementation - like:     http://paranoiaworks.mobi/sse   
 the most commonly used encryption/decryption technique is aes. you can find more information visit  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/advanced_encryption_standard ? you simply need to define a key(anything like for example: 25346483936) which will be common both at mobile as well as server end along with an iv_vector which is required for cryptography it will be more clear from the code below.  ote: the length of the key must be equal to iv_vector array size  it is 16 in the below example. now using the encrypt method you can encrypt any information before sending it to server over a non-secure network. similarly you can decrypt information received from server using decryptdata class.         * this class is used to decrypt an encrypted string value.  *   * @author kthakur  *  */ public class encryptdecrytdata {         }  
 you will need a central server which provides certificates for each user to authenticate users (otherwise you will always be vulnerable to a man in the middle attack).  so for two users (joe and sally)  there will be  three  certificates: 1) the certificate authenticating your central server  2) the certificate authenticating joe and 3) the certificate authenticating sally.    so when joe wants to initiate communication with sally the following should happen:       joe requests sally's public key from the central server.      joe authenticates the server via the server's public key (by checking the digital certificate).    joe uses the server's public key to encrypt a shared secret key and then sends the encrypted shared secret key to the server.   only the server can decrypt joe's shared secret key and thus uses this shared secret key to encrypt (via  symmetric cryptography ) sally's public key and sends sally's public key  encrypted via joe's proposed shared secret key  to joe.   joe now has sally's public key; authenticated because it came from an authenticated server.      joe sends a request to sally to initiate communication identifying themselves as \"joe\" along with a digital certificate.      sally authenticates \"joe\" via the central server.   sally retrieves joe's public key in the same way that joe obtained sally's public key from the central server.      sally sends a shared secret key to joe.      sally uses joe's public key to encrypt a multi-part message which includes 1) the shared secret key and 2) a digital certificate encrypted with sally's private key.    joe receives sally's encrypted message (which only joe can decrypt since it was encrypted with joe's public key).      joe decrypts the message and receives sally's proposed shared secret key.    joe receives sally's digital certificate  encrypted with joe's public key  and attempts to decrypt with sally's public key obtained previously from the central server.    if joe successfully decrypts the digital certificate  then joe can be assured that sally is the one who proposed the shared secret key.   joe sends an acknowledgement of the shared secret to sally via symmetric cryptography  using the shared secret key.     sally receives joe's acknowledgement via sally's proposed shared secret key.   sally and joe can now communicate back and forth using symmetric cryptography via sally's originally proposed shared secret key.      so why is all of this necessary?  first  you need a \"trusted\" broker (that's the central server).  otherwise you can never be sure who you are communicating with.  you may ask: why does sally need to sign her shared secret key when only joe can decrypt it anyway (if sally uses joe's public key to encrypt)?  the reason is that  anyone  can encrypt a shared secret key via joe's public key!  therefore if joe receives an unsigned shared secret key  he may start communicating with a man in the middle who simply generated a shared secret key using joe's public key.  just as sally needs some confirmation that joe is the actual entity trying to communicate with her  joe needs some assurance that the shared secret key he receives is  actually  from sally (hence why she needs to sign with her private key).    rsa is  not safe !!!  given enough traffic  it  is  possible to decrypt messages encoded by rsa.  thus  you should have a protocol in place for periodically updating public/private keys used for authentication.  this is simple for users: your central server will hold the public keys for each user.  periodically your server should request that each user generate a new private/public key pair and send the public key to the server to be updated (this communication can be done via the previous private/public key used by each user).      it's a little more \"difficult\" for the central server itself.  if your central server wishes to change its private/public key (authenticating the server)  then it needs to communicate with every user to make each user aware of the change.  when a user changes his/her private/public key  it's a one-to-one communication (just between the user and the server) but when the  server  wants to change  its  private/public key  it must communicate with  all  users!     caveat:     i don't claim that what i proposed above is the \"canonical\" pattern.  what i claim  is that if you follow the above  you will will ensure both authenticity and integrity. i.e. you can be guaranteed to be communicating with the entity the central server considers to be \"joe\" and \"sally\"  and  you can guarantee that  only  joe and sally can communicate because no one  including the central server  knows the shared secret key used by joe and sally to communicate (except for joe and sally of course).

 you only need to null the pojo reference  not the references held in the pojo.    the garbage collector traces from the program  roots  to find potentially live objects  where the roots are generally the references on the stack i.e. the references in a method invocation.  if an object is not reachable from the roots  then none of the objects referenced by that object are transitively reachable through that object  although the referenced objects may be directly reachable via the roots or through another chain of objects that's reachable through the roots.  but if an object isn't reachable because you've nulled out all references to it then it doesn't matter what other objects are referenced by the object (including self references)  because these references won't be traced by the garbage collector - hence you don't need to null the references held by the object.    if you haven't already done so  then i recommend using something like  eclipse's memory analyzer  to help you figure out where the leak is occurring.    one memory leak scenario is that you've got a big collection full of everything that is making objects reachable even after they're nulled out everywhere else in the program; in this case your options are to remove mostly-dead objects from these data structures  or if this isn't practical/feasible you can fill the collection with  weakreferences  or  softreferences  - these tell the garbage collector \"it's fine to reclaim an object if the only references held to it are weak or soft\" (weak references are typically collected more eagerly than soft references).  if the big collection is a map then java provides a  weakhashmap  that you can use instead.

 in fragement class one method is there by using that you can get context.         just assign that method parameter to a field then you can access this activity reference as context where ever you want. because activity is subclass of context.

 when you use your   method as the filter of the stream  it means that in order to evaluate the filter's predicate for a specific worker  the worker has to finish its work.    when you run this code as a parallel stream  however  it's possible that the filter would be applied on multiple workers at the same time  in which case  the first one to finish would give you the output. however  you have no control over how many threads the parallel stream will use. it may decide that some of the workers should be processed on the same thread  in which case some of them won't be processed at all (since your terminal operation requires that only one worker finishes its processing).    therefore  if your goal is that   is executed for all workers at the same time  you can't use a stream (not even a parallel stream).  
 you seem to have a serious misconception about  .  s are not meant to launch workers. in fact  if you use   it may happen that it starts no worker but the first one. and so it also doesnt wait for all workers to finish but only for currently pending threads. but since you have a rather small stream it might be the case that all workers have been started already because there are as much threads available in your environment. but this is not a guaranteed behavior.    note that if you use a sequential stream instead of a parallel stream it will for sure process the first item only (as it returns  ) and none of the other. but since the stream implementation cant predict that result it will respect you request to accelerate the operation via parallel execution and may start processing more items in advance using more threads.

 it would be a terrible idea to modify the code of your sorting algorithm just to adapt to a particular data type whereas your sorting class uses generics.    you have already wrapped your data in a   class  so all you need to do is to implement the   interface.  
 the normal way to do this would be to use an interface on gameobject.         then just have each object implement gameobject.         then your update loop looks like this.         i can't guarantee you this is faster  but it probably is.  the compiler will likely be able to optimize a virtual call like this (virtual calls are common in object oriented programming  so it's a really good thing for the compiler to know how to optimize)  whereas i don't think it's going to be able to optimize an explicit check of the the instance class type nearly as well.  
 try this one  it should resolve your problem:       
 if the implementation of the interface methods doesn't depend on members of the implementing classes  and you are using java 8  you can give the interface's methods a default implementation.  
 you can use the \"delegation\" pattern. define a new interface with a method (or methods) defining the behavior you want to add  and an implementation class for each variant of the behavior. have each of your existing classes reference an instance of whichever implementation class it needs.  the wikipedia page for \"delegation pattern\" has some good simple examples in java and other languages:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delegation_pattern   
 you'd need to use a   to make it lazy:         example  in the same vein as mike's answer:         output:       
 you can accomplish this by using a short circuiting stream in java 8. you can apply a mapping to the result to make the result also come out as an    rather than an  .         output:       
 you say:   'object \"face\" which is of type \"facer\" which extends jpanel' . i read this as saying you have something like:         and then later you have:         now  in your output  you are trying to find the output  . your issue is that you have misunderstood what the name is on a swing component.... the name is a value that can be given to a swing component (using  setname(string) ) to give it some meaningful name for the application.    what you are really looking for is the classname  the name of the  type  of the component.    your   class may be in the default package  or it may be in one of your own packages. if  for example  the   class is in the package   then  if you add the code:         then it will output:         if you want just the simple class name  then try:       
 your issue is not related to sonarqube because sonarqube just reads and processes the report generated by your code coverage tool. if you have a look at the byte code  the \"assert\" keyword is likely to generate some extra code  thus some extra branches. if your coverage tool is jacoco  see  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jacoco/kjhbx_exraa  for example.  
 try adding \"class.forname():         the basic problem is that earlier versions of java/jdbc used odbc to connect to ms-access ... and the odbc driver has been removed from java 8.    two alternatives are to use:    1) ucanaccess:  http://ucanaccess.sourceforge.net/site.html     ... or ...    2) jackcess (jackcess 2.0: new crunchy outside  same yummy filling!):  http://jackcess.sourceforge.net/     if that doesn't work:    3) please specify what what ide you're using (eclipse  etc - if applicable)    4) make sure your jackcess-2.0.7.jar is explicitly included in the classpath (how to do this depends on your ide)    5) consider using a directory  without  spaces in the name

 the square brackets   are only used when you declare an array  initialize an array or access an element of the array.    when you just assign a value to the entire array you don't need them.    therefore  change your code to :       
      by calling the above line for each line you read in the file you will be overwriting the contents of your array each time. if this is not what you want to do then i suggest using an arraylist (which will scale in size dynamically).         then simply call         for each line read from file.  
 you have your encoding/decoding backwards    base64 is a way to turn a byte array into a string that can easily be passed around without messing up the byte encoding.    therefore you  encode  a byte array into a string and then  decode  it back into a byte array    if you switch the order of your encoding and decoding          it will print this:         it also appears you are using the   base64 classes which is not a good idea.  those are internal classes and there is no guarantee that they will be around in a future version of java or that they are present in all java implementations.    if you are using java 8  you can use the new   class  javadoc here  and if you are on pre java 8 you should use a  3rd party library which has base64 classes instead.  
 most database-system-specific   implementations default to localhost and the default port of that database system. you don't need to set the jdbc url  as those datasources are configured using properties for individual elements like hostname  databasename  etc (they usually don't even have a property for the entire url!).    so if your database is running on localhost  you only need to set the databasename  username and password  and the datasource will know how to connect.  
 you have have to put this loop inside a thread. if you run it at the gui thread like you are doing now  gui will not paint it's components(because it is getting busy in the loop) and will looks empty.       
 instead of sleeping  you could have your thread wait for an object to be notified with a timeout. you would then notify the object if you want the thread to wake up or interrupt it.  
 you can use interrupt method. it will give interrupt signal to sleep method. you will catch   and it will return from method.  
 you have to use the wait() and notify() function.    wait() tells the calling thread to give up the monitor and go to sleep until some other thread enters the same monitor and calls notify( ).    notify() wakes up the first thread that called wait() on the same object.    so you can keep another button like 'resume button' which triggers the event to notify().  
 you can write a cookie to the client side on submit and then you check if that cookie is there you show the message if not you go through normal processing  
 assuming that you have a jsp like login.jsp which posts to servlet e.g. myservlet which in turn calls a method to query  to database. i would try the below :-      post the user provided values to the servlet myservlet (post method). now use these values on a method which queries the database and finds whether this user already exists.       2.if yes   then use requestdispatcher to the login.jsp . this time give a message that the user already exists. the user needs to fill the info again with new username post the values again.      if the user doesn't exists   continue the normal flow and create the user.    
 1)if you are using ajax for submitting your form data you can write responses and the same will be displayed  eg:-         2) if you are not using ajax  you can write your response in servlet in an attribute and print the response from that attribute in jsp  eg:-         and in jsp         but as scriptlets in jsp are discouraged you can use jstl tags eg:-       
 a ciphersuite is something that is used internally in a jsse provider  it defines the primitives used within the tls protocol. it's not a    a   instance in java represents one primitive used for encryption/decryption such as aes or rsa.  
 you must return false to propagate the touch event so the click listener can capture the click event so:               
     what could be the reason for this discrepancy between the same values?      you could have two objects of the same type  one displayed  whose state is being changed  and one not displayed that you're checking in the if block.     but again  for better help  consider creating and posting a  minimal  complete  and verifiable example program . we don't want to see your whole program  but rather you should condense your code into the smallest bit that still compiles  has no extra code that's not relevant to your problem  but still demonstrates your problem. as an aside  you will never want to use a mouselistener with a jbutton as you're doing. instead use an actionlistener as that is what it was built for.  
     \"i've added a mouselistener to the login button\"  - not a good idea  buttons should use    see  how to write an action listeners  and  how to use buttons  check boxes  and radio buttons ;        is a really  really bad idea which could lock up your ui and suggests that you violating the single thread rules of swing.  see  concurrency in swing  for more details.       what it sounds like you need is a modal dialog  which can block the execution of the code at the point the dialog is made visible...    see  how to make dialogs  for more details    take a look at  java swing - where do actionlisteners belong according to mvc pattern?  for an example of a login dialog/form using the mvc paridigm ( model-view-controller )  
 turns out as @madprogrammer suggested  that i was creating two different loginpage objects in my display class. it's curious  however  that the mouselistener on the login page gui that was visible actually listened for  and returned expected results of the better defined login page object (which was invisible).   
 the operation          in your thread code isn't thread-safe. your threads are stepping on each others' operations.    by sheer luck  the thread-safe parts of println are synchronizing your threads' operations well enough to prevent the adverse interactions on your static variable. when you comment out the println call  you lose that lucky sync.    you can use a synchronized variable if you need to use something like this for production.  
 these are the following two reasons.      counter++   thread scheduling.       counter++     it is not a thread safe.    ex. counter = 0.  thread 1 &amp; thread 2 try to increment the value at the same time. both will get the value from main memory. increments in thread memory . so now counter is 1. update in main memory to 1 instead of 2. you can overcome this using   or  .     thread scheduling:     thread scheduling is done by os. there is no guarantee in order. even if you submit thread1&amp;thread2&amp;thread3 in same order. it may run on different order.  
 your counter variable is static and shared between all the threads you create and each thread is changing the counter on its own. try removing 'static' from counter variable.    this:         to this:       
   is a shared variable among threads that is not protected by any lock or synchronization  so the   statements on the various threads will \"trample into each other\" in unpredictable ways.  presumably the   introduces enough delay to counteract that  though this can't be guaranteed 100%.  what are you  trying  to accomplish...?!  
 that's because   is not an atomic operation. what actually happens is more like this:      read   from memory and store in a local copy   increment the local copy   write the local copy back      and that's bad  because this is done concurrently by multiple threads  so it's easily possible for two threads simultaneously to read the number  increment it locally and then both will write the same number back. that will effectively discard one of the increments.    therefore  read on synchronization  locks  and atomic types. in this case  e.g. an     might come in handy:         and then instead of    you'd do    
 this import:         doesn't import   itself  just any classes defined within that class. add:         as well.

 change this to          this          because   is always true.    if   then   is true    if   then   is  true.    so while condition is always true what you need is not   but   [and ]  
      replace your code with:       
   is always true. as or operation works as follows    condition 1 condition 2 result    true              true    true    true              false   true    false             true    true    false             false   false    in your case one condition will be always true  therefore it enters in while loop everytime while and operation works as follows      condition 1    condition 2 result    true              true    true    true              false   false    false             true    false    false             false   false    so instead of using or try using and e.g.    
 you should change your code to

 that's the documented and expected behaviour. rtfm (read the fine manual) at  http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-neo4j/docs/3.2.1.release/reference/html/#reference_programming-model_typerepresentationstrategy  :        each node gets labeled with its type and all supertypes and interfaces that are also @nodeentity-annotated. there is a special label prefixed with _ that represents the current type of the entity.    
 no  it calls the parent's class method so it has a chance to run what it needs to run. if you were to use something like this.onoptionsitemselected(item); then it would be a infinite loop.  
 you are using fragment  that's way you have to use   instead of   to work with context.    change         to         so do this change and put admob code in   part.  
 you need to change the arguments to the add method  it expects the index to be the first argument. see  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/linkedlist.html#add(int %20e) .       
 well you're not really referring to \"this\" anymore in the constructor you've written. you create a linked list l and modify that one  but you never actually work on \"this\". also i agree with the others  the second for loop is unnecessary.    this also lets you use    which is a cool functionality to get to know. helps you keep your code dry and bug free.       
 another way of doing this would be to just add    in the loop. with this new elements are guaranteed to be inserted at the end of the list.    i would use   when i want to insert specifically at a given location.  
 does your class extend  linkedlist ? if so  here is what i would do:         it isn't a great idea to extend linkedlist. if you want an easy way to create a new linkedlist with elements use the following method:       
 well  that was kind of stupid... the listener have to be added to the    resulting in an obvious code (in  ) :       
 i have found the answer for my problem. in order to draw an image and a shape  one can use a pixmap. it is possible to first create a pixmap on which you draw a rectangle. then  you create another pixmap on which you draw the image. both pixmap then can be combined by drawing one pixmap onto the other.    this is the code i use to build an image containing a rectangle indicating the actual health level and drawing the indicator image on top of it.       
  http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-pmd-plugin/pmd-mojo.html#language     there is no way currently to have it check for \"jsp\" as the source type without modifying the plugin.    you might want to try maven-exec with direct command line options of pmd as short-cut.     http://mojo.codehaus.org/exec-maven-plugin/     http:://pmd.sourceforge.net/pmd-5.2.1/usage/running.html

 if you look at the  source code for java's system class   you can see that it initially assigned to  :         this says it is final... so how is it modified? well  these fields on    are special - see  jls 17.5.4. write-protected fields .        normally  a field that is final and static may not be modified.   however  system.in  system.out  and system.err are static final fields   that  for legacy reasons  must be allowed to be changed by the methods   system.setin  system.setout  and system.seterr. we refer to these   fields as being write-protected to distinguish them from ordinary   final fields.      reading some of the documentation on the class you can see a few methods that initializes the class:         those       and   are all native methods that allow the field to be changed. you can see that in the normal case   is going to be a  .         in addition to that    also offers a view methods that allow you to change where those streams go to. for example  for changing the \"standard\" input stream:       
 when you do a   you will always get a new copy of the class.   to use the spring instancing feature you need to let spring do your configuration for you for example by using the     annotation.    as far as the issue of multiple requests hitting the single instance at the same time  you must either make your class stateless or thread-safe.   this is a topic that can't be answered simply  but you can start  here.    
 you need to write stateless beans (means there should not be any data storage with in bean) in order to not to worry about thread safety. or you need to handle thread safety by yourself. spring by default create singleton non-thread safe instances of a class. even \"prototype\" scope is not thread safe. when you define scope as prototype  it just means spring will create a new instance each time it is  injected  in another component  not that an instance be created each time these component executed.     for example  class a injected in two components as bean a1 and a2. there will  only two  instances in the springcontext  even when millions requests are served by these components.     see this  question  to learn more about different design strategies you can follow.    by the way  i do not see any need of private int a  b declaration at class level in your example. in fact it is not even used and hence this bean is thread safe.   
 1) if you rely on spring to manage your beans and as you say use the default singleton scope then the same instance will be used by the other beans. however if you instantiate the class yourself (for example by using  ) then there will be a new instance of your class each time.    2) if you have 100 concurrent requests  then there will be 100 threads and all of them can call your class simultaneously without blocking. that said  you can cause the threads to wait for each other (for example by using   or any  lock  class). naturally  performance will suffer since you now have a situation where 99 threads are waiting. the only reason why you would prefer such a solution is if your bean has a shared  mutable  state  and that is something i advise against. along these lines you can remove the instance variables   and   from your example. after all  they were not used anyway since both   and   were passed as method arguments:       
 it reloads the entity after storing it  and by default it only loads a shallow copy of related information.    you can use   or   or add @fetch to the tasks list for instance.  
 based on your compiler step  change this         to         which will add the current directory to the classpath for the java runtime environment. see also the oracle technote  setting the class path .    a jar file is a kind of zip  and should have a   extension. so this         should probably be         and you can check if the file is valid with any zip archive reader. including jar itself           edit     based on your comments below          and then        
 the alpha component has no intrinsic meaning in opengl.    people often assume that it automatically means transparency  but that is really just a consequence of the way blending and   (used to) work.    typically when you want the alpha component to do something you use alpha blending:         or an alpha test:         the latter is not supported in modern opengl because this test can be implemented in a fragment shader using  you guessed it   .    in either case  you have to enable   or   respectively for them to do anything.       as for the differences between   and using a  0.0  alpha value   with   alpha blending    will actually discard depth and stencil values in addition to eliminating the source color.   serves a similar role in places where it is supported (it is/was a per-fragment test that occurs after the fragment shader runs and discards fragments that fail the test).  
 you will have to set the color parameters  red  green and blue  to the same values to archive a grey color. the   constructor accepts rgb values between [0  255]  so you will have to scale your r values to match the [0  255] scale:            being the biggest r value in your file.    then set your color to          to make the whole thing more efficient  i would suggest creating an array of grey colors first to avoid creating a lot of duplicate   objects:         and then set the   in your loop to        
 in older version  (assuming your opengl to java wrapper was a thin one) you got c-style undefined behavior. in other words  anything could happen  up to and including making demons come out of your nose. but it usually just means a crash or garbage on the screen.    in newer versions if one of the rubustness extensions are available then you won't get a crash but the values passed to the shader may still be garbage or just set to 0.    there is no way to reuse the uv data like that that doesn't involve using a sampler and slowing down the rendering. it's just easier to duplicate the data and be done with it.  
 this could be worth a shot.         otherwise the cause of the issue could be somewhere else.  
 1) close project    2) restart eclipse    3) open project    4) clean project    that might help  
 please check your xml the line written below is there or not on the top        
 you should just do a check for null on the tempobject  if there is any chance that object.get(i) would return null in some circumstances.         }    how ever  as the other answer suggests  you first need to find out where the npe is being thrown. you can do this in 2 ways:      look at the stackstrace   use the debugger in your ide  and take one line of code at a time  to see when it's throwing the exception      you said that you're doing this to destroy the object  after it's been used. so first of all  make sure you're passing the right objekt into the method. and then again; if there is any chance that this object might already have been destroyed by another process  you can do the null check for the object as well:         }    but yes - learn how to use your ide's debugging tool  and google the exceptions that are being thrown  and try to understand why.  
     for some reason when the object gets hit the app crashes with the null pointer exception.      it happens because you have a null reference (or references) and the where the mpe occurred is not expecting this.  specifically  an npe  could  occur in that method for a couple of reasons:       if   is   then   will throw an npe     if the   list contains any   references  then you will get an npe at          update  for the new stacktrace:    the only way you can get an npe thrown by   (in the version you showed us) is is   is  .       you haven't provided enough information to figure out  why  there are unexpected nulls.         any ideas?      i recommend you follow the approach i described here:       what is a null pointer exception  and how do i fix it?     
 you have to fix you classpath  just include the jar which contains the main class (the class that contains the main method) in the classpath. like this:         all about setting the classpath is here :  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/classpath.html   
 to troubleshoot  can you add an  echo  statement at the final java execution ? alternatively  you can invoke the script using  bash -x   
     uses   to compare its arguments  but array types don't override that method. so two array instance will always be different.    use     to compare arrays of type  .  
 the problem is that   returns a    and arrays are  s in java.  however  these array objects don't override   's   method   which is responsible for the output you see.        in other words  this method returns a string equal to the value of:           the output includes the hash code  which is different for every object  even if the contents are the same.    use     to obtain a   with the contents of the array  e.g.         3 times.  new output:       
 so i think you need to create an application where you can reply to  specific  client like in a chat application.    i will provide some suggestions you could try out. in a real environment what we do in a chat is  send reply to a person using their own chat window. that means we use some kind of an id to identify  who we talk with .     you can do the same in the given scenario. you can use   to identify required client who you need to reply. but first you will have to map  client id  to the client's identity details such as socket  ip and port. [ you can have threads to handle client's incoming messages separately]    use hash map to do the mapping [  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/hashmap.html  ] and use unique client id's so you will not get any collisions. and as value of the hash map store client details [socket   ip and port] in a structure like object.    whenever you need to reply to a client use a separate  reply  function which will send message to the specific client using socket details extracted from hash map. and main point of the answer :         you will have to specify which client you need to reply to [in a   console application provide client id as first word or what ever   mechanism].      please ask for any clarification i will try my best to answer   
 your class is implementing a different interface than hibernate is expecting. you are implementing:          while hibernate was compiled against / expects:         the answer is likely much better  explained here     to quote \"hibernate keeps changing the package containing the connectionprovider base class. it changed from version 3 to 4 and has changed again with verson 4.3.\"    having said that  this only explains why you have the problem and shows what you're doing wrong but it doesn't solve your problem. what is the final-patched-play-1.1.1 library? if this is the latest version then i guess you will have to downgrade to hibernate 3 in order to use it.  
 the way to do something like this would be to use an \"offset\". unfortunately  the way offset it implemented  it doesn't \"skip\" looking at 1-50. it'll read them (costing you a read in your daily quotas/budgets)  and return the following results. it will do what you want  but it will still charge you  unfortunately     you'd have to write something like          look into  this  if you need additional info :)  
 simply use       
 to clarify  the following would do the trick on  jdk pre 1.7. when trying to switch the order of declaration of u and t i get  . as in other posts  it doesn't seem to be an issue with newer jdk versions.    as per this  post  this was fixed in jdk 1.7       
 could you try to add additional   by using the   tag into the xml.          this question  has more information about it.    for pageable    used is    and register using java configuration by adding the   annotation.  
 because the type of the parameter to   is t  and you are sending an integer  which is not compatible. ask yourself this: if you know that   is an    why do you declare it as t?    
  public abstract class abstractparameter implements comparable  will produce compilation error because inside   you are invoking   on   and since there is no upperbound on t(t can be anything) the compiler can't resolve method      you mentioned that \"the tempval will be an integer\" in your post. so change the class definition to include this info in order to avoid unchecked warning       
 in java your   variable of type   is not a pointer like in c. so doing   simply gives you the next letter (as in next in the character table  not your string) after    which is  . so as a result your   will never be equal neither to   nor to  .    you may want to get the next character the same way you are getter the character into   - as a separate variable  and check that against the tab and space. like so:         this is of course very crude and prone to errors  but i hope it explains your current issue.    there are better ways to do what you are trying to do.  
 just iterate your string and collect the character before the space...             result       
 have you try java regular expression?       
 no  you need to implement the generic form of the    interface   so that you can take a   as a argument to the   method.       
 don't use a mouselistener on a jbutton since by doing this  your button will not respond to space bar presses if it has focus  and also if you disable the button  your mouselistener will still work  which is not correct behavior.     instead use an actionlistener  a single one is all you need  one that is added to each and every button  and get the action command from the actionevent parameter.       
 look at your code  you only have a single attribute   which value is printed in your   method  so nothing surprising here.    each button must have its own listener  so remove your attribute and use this code :         you can also use an   instead of a  .  
 you have to declare an array of buttons then loop it to declare all buttons and to add action listener   
 the following regex can give you the idea:              replace it with       demo   
 you set a cursor on a query when you have it. otherwise  you simply don't set it - this will query from the very beginning.    for example:       
 i think this could be your issue         you are filling the   up to 5000  and then you try to persist / merge them. i'm not sure about hibernate  but eclipselink's default shared cache size is 1000. that means  you could fill up   with  for example  2000 existing  s and  by the time you call   on them  they are no longer in entity manager's cache. this leads to calling   on detached instance which has   already set.    in your case  i think it would be perfectly ok to call   on all objects  regardless of weather it is an existing object or not  because it will update existing ones  and persist new ones.  
 i hope you are using latest  .  and i expect that it is a typo here:            otherwise it looks quite interesting  you could try to do following things:       flush session after each (10  1000) persisted objects  like that:          use less exotic way to check if entity was persisted already:         or it is better completely avoid   and just work with managed objects  this will require a single transaction for all operations  thus will require redesign of the things.      
 i ran the code on the production server again and i got a transactionrollbackexception right before the detached entity exceptions. i think that this might be the actual cause of the exception i observed.    the transaction timed out and was rolled back due to the huge number of objects i was trying to save  and this led to the foo objects becoming detached. somehow the transactionrollbackexception didnt show up in the logs the first time around  probably because it happened exactly at 12:0am ut. in support of this theory  the program hasn't crashed so far after i decreased the batch size to ~1000    for those interested  a transactionrollbackexception does lead to entities getting detached:  entitymanager.gettransaction().rollback() detaches entities?     there are ways to handle this when it occurs  but i opted against implementing them for simplicity's sake  
 no  there is no faster way.  you have to go through the code line by line.      there are plenty of gotchas  since internationalization is about more than just string constants.    you may already know that number formats and date formats need to be localized  but you'll need to be on the lookout for numbers and dates being embedded into strings via concatenation or stringbuilder.append calls.  you'll also need to be on the lookout for implicit tostring() calls  such as when a number or date is supplied as a swing model value (for example  returning a number from the tablemodel.getvalueat method)  or when a jsp or jsf el expression refers to such a value directly instead of formatting it.    similarly  keep an eye out for enum constants directly displayed to the user  implicitly invoking their tostring() method.    creating sentences through string concatenation is a problem not only because of the formatting of numbers  dates  and enums  but also because other languages may have different ordering of sentence structure.  such string concatenation should be replaced with localized messageformats.    keystrokes need to be localized  including all mnemonics (and accelerators if it's a desktop app).    layouts are an issue.  places where the application assumes left-to-right orientation are something you'll want to address; even if you're only planning to localize for other left-to-right languages  you probably know that putting off good i18n practices is asking for trouble later down the line.    if your app is a swing application  you'll want to convert left/west and right/east layout constraints to line_start and line_end.  if your app is a web application  you'll need to factor out margin-left  margin-right  padding-left  padding-right  border-left  and border-right (and probably many others i'm forgetting) into lang-specific css blocks.    swing apps also need to call  applycomponentorientation  after building each window  usually right before calling  .    some programmers like to store parts of a ui in a database.  i'm not talking about user content (which you shouldn't localize);  i'm talking about label text  window titles  layout constraints  and so on.  i have a hearty dislike for that practice  personally  but people do it.  if your app is doing that  i guess either the database table needs a locale column  or the practice of storing the ui in the database needs to be removed entirely.    to answer your final question  if there are any better strategies than stepping through the code  i've never heard of them.  you could just search for double-quote characters in the code  of course.  i suppose the choice depends on how professional and polished your superiors want the application to look.    one thing i've learned is that throw-away code often isn't.  don't be surprised if that rewrite ends up trying to salvage large swaths of code from the legacy version.  
 you could turn field 'label' into enum in which enum values are ordered by your custom order.         then  you can implement a comparable in order to sort the set.         you can then use collections.sort method for your sorting.  
 you can use a map to define an order for an arbitrary set of strings:         be careful  however... you can't sort a set. if it's a sortedset (like a treeset) it will sort itself  if it's not it has no defined order.  
 apparently despite the fact that the method takes a password parameter  the   implementation does not support this  take a look at line 200 in  the source .    in any case  a password  whether strong or weak that is stored anywhere on the device is unsafe.  this is  especially  true of source code (including source code in general  non-android contexts).  if i get my hands on your app's apk  i can use one of several excellent apk analysis tools to access the class's constant pool  which will contain the password in plain text.  no amount of obfuscation could prevent this  or even make it more difficult.  this is perhaps the reason that the   implementation doesn't allow this.    the whole point of the key store service on android device (it's actually implemented as a separate process you can talk to via a unix socket) is to protect access to sensitive material by requiring a users passcode to unlock it  so there's no point in putting a password on your key pairs or other secrets..  in more recent phones  this is all implmented in hardware  which provides very strong security.  
 this is a >  link  explaining how to load or reload a class dynamically in java using reflection. also  you might find this  post  useful  and apply it like this:    this.ma = class.forname(ma.class.getname()).newinstance();     also  you should pay attention  if you want to use what it previously contained  you have to follow the indications in the first link to reload that class.

 i believe  the default behavior for transactional junit tests in spring is to rollback after each test. therefore  the once off db population you do in   gets rolled back after the first test  leading to the 2nd test failing because the database is now empty.    you could reverse this behavior by annotating the test class with  .    however  it can be considered a bad practice to have stateful tests  whereby data is persisted after one test  with the potential to impact the results of the next and to yield different results based on the execution order.    instead  you may be better off removing the \"if\" from your   and re-populating your db anew for each test pass.  
 you annotated your class as    what means that every   method will be executed within a transaction. method annotated with   is executed before each of test method  but within the same transaction as the test method. be aware of the fact that   is default for test environment. so if you run your tests one of many possible scenarios is:      a new transaction is open   whole   is executed what means that some test data are created using   and after that the flag   is set to true     is executed succesfully as there are test data available   the transaction is rolled back what means that test data created by   is gone   a new transaction is open   setup method is early returned as   is true at this point     is executed but there is no test data available   the transaction is rolled back      for more information look at  the section spring testing annotations of the spring reference documentation     
 my guess is that you have intermixed javax.persistence and org.eclipse.persistence.annotations packages.  using javax.persistence package classes  you may use an empty converter annotation on the converter class and a convert annotation on the entity class specifying the converter class.  
 your configuration should implement     (usually you would extend from  ) to customize how caching works.  
 calling a stored procedure over a database link should be as simple as adding an   sign and the database link name after the stored procedure  for example:       
 your first issue is that your current   method doesn't make sense as a public interface because you're relying on the class to generate the random number and read the file. so  you shouldn't need to send this in  although you could; it just wouldn't work  or make any difference  for your configuration.    so  the answer is  you need to have a method that takes no arguments and returns a string. allow your code to do what you want.         but then in   you need to keep the string for a bit until the user exhausts their guesses.       
   is a folder that seems to index and store recently used   in your project. expand   and check for multiple jars of the same name  which is the problem i've usually had in the past.    the error on   probably means you have an xml file with an error in it.  
 the problem is that somebody in another thread changes the   set  while it is being copied  in  .    you cannot do this without synchronization. or use   instead of    
 it looks like you want       
 you need to put your   into a while loop and create a new thread for every client accepted  which handles the connection.  
 you are still trying to handle clients in your main thread. main thread should just accept new connections and start new threads. you also have to do   in a loop so multiple connections can be accepted:       
 well  opencv is not compiled with  cmu  camera support by default  but it supports it. you can  try to enable this feature  and rebuild opencv.    another alternative requires to  use  libdc1394  to retrieve frames   and then convert that data to a  .  
 take a look at  file leak detector  written by kohsuke kawaguchi of jenkins fame. it is a java agent that you attach to your java process.    there are also other ways to scan for them via findbugs/pmd  etc. i'd take a look at  sonarqube . there are rules specifically about not closing resources.  
 try this:         for more information look at  spring reference documentation   
 i think it should rather be         but if you don't care about the dynamic part  you can use          or even use  tuckey rewrite filter  to rewrite the url so that it could be captured by your existing controller method. i believe that rewrite rule can be       
 if you look closely at the tutorials for jackson  you will see that the json this library produces itself for empty arrays uses this notation:      therefore you may try replacing any singular   value in an array with just an empty array before sending your json to jackson  it should accept without throwing any exceptions.     canonically  a ' null' member of an array is actually valid json syntax. see also  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/json . members of an array can be of any type  thus they can be:       strings    numbers    booleans    arrays    objects   null      for your usage scenario however  i would recommend using the empty array instead  because it is simply far easier to program with. for example  consider a usage case where you call some function   on each of your 'years' which wants an integer input. code like        will fail because you will call   with a 'null' type instead of an integer  causing errors. if you instead used the empty array  the correct behaviour will happen without having to treat the case where there are no years diffrently by explicitly looking for the null. just makes your life easier that way.   
 issue solved. for future reference:    the dot class should in no case extend papplet  this only should be the case for main activity. however  when the dot class does not extend papplet  eclipse gives errors  which is not surprising  because it does not understand any of the processing commands. to solve that  the papplet class should be declared at the beginning and then in the constructor papplet should be passed as an argument and assigned to the variable we declared at the beginning. now  all processing commands should be treated as methods of the parent class. this is the following code for dot (the only change i put in the mainactivity class is to call dot with  this  as an additional argument):         the solution to the issue is best described here:     https://processing.org/tutorials/eclipse/     under the section  processing in eclipse with multiple classes .  
 yours is a classic swing threading issue where you perform a long-running task on the swing event thread. you appear in fact to be doing long-running code in the painting method  something that should absolutely never be done since this will repeatedly perform this task every time a repaint is performed  slowing your painting to a crawl.    suggestions:      do long-running tasks  such as reading files  in a background thread such as provided by a swingworker.   do only painting in paint methods  and nothing else.   call the super's paintcomponent method in your override to allow the jpanel to do its house-keeping painting.   if you are going to be swapping  views   use a cardlayout to make it easy and safe to do so.   the   loop is doing the same thing -- tying up the swing event thread  freezing your gui. use a swing timer instead for this.   you've got game logic in your painting method (the paintcomponent method)  where you're setting the x and y variables. don't do this  but instead change them in your swing timer's code. you never have complete control over whether or if the paintcomponent method is called  and so you want to have no program logic  no code that changes fields  within this method.      for example:            for example:       
 the problem with your streams code is that you're reading a byte at a time  which is slow  and also appending to the   one at a time  ditto. try this:         note that it isn't correct to use read timeouts as a means to separate requests. you need to parse the data to do that. tcp is a streaming protocol without message boundaries  and there are no guarantees about separate sends being received separately.  
 you have to use   or similar method. end of http header is marked by empty line. if you don't detect lines you cannot know when to stop reading data. relying on timeouts or tcp fragments is not a correct solution. if request doesn't contain new line  you need to wait until one appears or the connection is terminated/timed out. you should wait at least a couple of seconds.    i would also get rid of those listeners. being able to add multiple listeners for single socket might seem like a good idea but the only sensible thing to do with http header is to parse it. the parser also needs to inform the reader when to stop reading.    i would start with something like this:       
 if you know you skip the first line you don't need a regex for that line then use:    pattern pattern = pattern.compile(\"[q|a][ ]*\");    string s = \"q   how much room was there between the bike rack and the snow pile?\";    matcher match = pattern.matcher(s);    system.out.println(match.replacefirst(\"\"));  
 no.  what that means is that this method (whatever it is) is used to retrieve data from the server in response to a request from the client.  normally  when a client is just asking for something  it should use an http get.  http post requests are intended for sending data  to  the server.    however  in this case  the client wants to send a (potentially large) object (called  ) to the server to describe what it wants.  that may be too big or cumbersome to do using a get request  so instead they've used post.  
 some obvious things to fix first.      you are using java 8  upgrade to jetty 9.2.6 (jetty 9.0.3 is too old and does not support java 8 well)   your dtd reference is bad  it is the one from jetty 7  it has been known to cause problems in jetty 9. use   instead.   your class reference is bad  and should be fixed.   doesn't exist    
 i imagine the output you're getting is 8 16 for 816 &amp; 0 16 for 1016.  you should really consider padding the 816 (ie. 0816) as that is the standard format for dealing with months.  then you would use:        datetimeformatter format =  datetimeformat.forpattern(\"mmyy\");    
 make sure the input string is 4 digit i.e in case of 810 .. make it as 0810. here is the response for the same    code:         response: 8 2010    hope this helps you!  
 try  . it sould give you an array of all files and directories in  . there are also versions of   that can filter out different kinds of files and/or directories which can be handy at times.     see java api for details:  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/file.html   
 one way with minimal changes is to synchronize access to the color array.     i personally would have the shared data abstracted out to an individual class which is completely thread-safe  that way you wouldn't have to make sure two separate parts of the code base both have to know what to synchronize on (it seems like your class here does more than just handle the map at first glance  perhaps it is such a class that i am describing though).       
 if you only want one thread modifying   at once  make it  .    the purpose of synchonization  is that it requires a thread to get the lock on the object. any other thread that attempts to access that object while its locked will be blocked (it will wait).    see this post:  java: how to synchronize array accesses and what are the limitations on what goes in a synchronized condition   
 suggestions:      use a model-view-control design for your program  or use one of the many similar variants.   use a swing timer to drive your gui game loop  but use real time slices  not the timer's delay  in your model to determine length of time between loop steps.   the model should run in the gui swing event thread.   but its long-running tasks should be run in background threads using a swingworker.   this is key: don't update the model's data  the data used by the jpanel to draw  until the background thread has completed working on it. a propertychangelistener and swingpropertychangesupport can be useful for this.   be sure that the jpanel draws in its   method  not its   method  and that you call the super method.   best if you make the background image a bufferedimage  and have the jpanel draw that in its   method for efficiency.   be sure that all swing gui code  except perhaps   calls  are called on the swing event thread.   and yes  definitely read the  concurrency in swing tutorial .    
 because the   method of   (or possibly  ) includes the brackets (and   inherits that  ). you could remove them by taking the substring like       
 overriding tostring() gives you full control over what get's returned. therefor  you can skip the brackets. however  you've only called the tostring() method (which is actually what the system.out.println() is actually doing as well. therefor  the outcome is as expected.  
 the following code would do the trick.        
 the error must be in the last bit of the chain  the piece of code not shown here that prints the response and that makes you think the transmission is broken.    the ios client and the java server can understand each other  and in fact the response is ??????? (i can't speak greek  but it seems the text you were looking for)    the text you see   is the same sequence of byte interpreted as some 7-bit encoding (maybe cp1252  aka latin 1 or cp1253  the greek code page  i can't tell because there seems to be a problem with the stackoverflow font  or anyway my test program could not produce that output)       here is the program  i used to analyze the \"incorrect\" response you posted at the end of your question   
 if you need this only in action listener just put there simple if/else or switch/case. if there is a chance that somewhere else you will need to create objects in similar way read about design patterns like factory method.  
 you're passing the result of calling file.listfiles() to the setfiles() method of your table model. listfiles() will return null if the file on which you're calling it is not a directory. this leads to the null pointer exception that you've run into.  
  note:  to restate the problem  as i understand it:  suppose you're given nonnegative integers a  b  and c.  is it possible  by performing a sequence of zero or more operations   or    to reach a point where  ?    ok  after looking into this further  i think you can make a small change to the statement you made in your question:        in order for this to be possible  the target number c  must be able to   be represented in the form:        c =  x a +  y b        where gcd( x   y ) = 1.      (also   x  and  y  need to be nonnegative; i'm not sure if they may be 0 or not.)    your original observation  that  x  may not equal  y  (unless they're both 1) and that  x  and  y  cannot both be even  are implied by the new condition gcd( x   y ) = 1; so those observations were correct  but not strong enough.    if you use this in your program instead of the test you already have  it may make the tests pass.  (i'm not guaranteeing anything.)  for a faster algorithm  you can use extended euclid's algorithm as suggested in the comments (and henry's answer) to find one  x  0  and  y  0 ; but if gcd( x  0   y  0 ) ? 1  you'd have to try other possibilities  x  =  x  0  +  n b   y  =  y  0  -  n a  for some  n  (which may be negative).    i don't have a rigorous proof.  suppose we constructed the set  s  of all pairs ( x   y ) such that (1 1) is in  s   and if ( x   y ) is in  s  then ( x   x + y ) and ( x + y   y ) are in  s .  it's obvious that (1  n ) and ( n  1) are in  s  for all  n  > 1.  then we can try to figure out  for some  m  and  n  > 1  how could the pair ( m   n ) get into  s ?  if  m  &lt;  n   this is possible only if ( m    n - m ) was already in  s .  if  m  >  n   it's possible only if ( m - n    n ) was already in  s .  either way  when you keep subtracting the smaller number from the larger  what you get is essentially euclid's algorithm  which means you'll hit a point where your pair is ( g   g ) where  g  = gcd( m   n ); and that pair is in  s  only if  g  = 1.  it appears to me that the possible values for  x  and  y  in the above equation for the target number c are exactly those which are in  s .  still  this is partly based on intuition; more work would be needed to make it rigorous.    
      idea:c=xa+by  because either x or y is bigger we can write the latter equation in one of two forms: c=x(a+b)+(y-x)b  c=y(a+b)+(x-y)a depending on who is bigger  so by reducing c by a+b each time  c eventually becomes: c=(y-x)b or c=(x-y)b  so c%b or c%a will evaluate to 0.  
 if we forget for a moment that   and   should be positive  the equation c = xa + yb has either no or infinitely many solutions. when c is not a multiple of gcd(a b) there is no solution.    otherwise  calling gcd(a b) = t use the extended euclidean algorithm to find d and e such that t = da + eb. one solution is then given by c = dc/t a + ec/t b.    it is clear that 0 = b/t a - a/t b so more solutions can be found by adding a multiple f of that to the equation:         when we now reintroduce the restriction that x and y must be positive or zero  the question becomes to find values of f that make x = (dc + fb)/t and y = (ec - af)/t both positive or zero.    if dc &lt; 0 try the smallest f that makes dc + fb >= 0 and see if ec - af is also >=0.    otherwise try the largest f (a negative number) that makes ec - af >= 0 and check if dc + fb >= 0.  
 i found solution on this article:  http://www.objectdb.com/java/jpa/query/jpql/path   
 you may check the documentation here:     http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/timepicker.html     it seems that specifically setis24hourview(boolean is24hourview) would be a useful method to look at!  
 you're missing a qualification to actually access the private field. currently you're trying to reassign the parameter passed to the constructor. instead you should use the following code:         this can be shortened even further by using the \"diamond operator\"  which is avaliable since java 7:       
 this is how you can do it         add the if(values != null) check before the assignment.whenever you use var args you are exposing a contract which will permit your clients to create an valid example object without any arguments.if you want to avoid that from happening then just use string[] values directly and throw an exception incase if it is null   
 other answers have addressed the cause  but wouldn't it be better to simply rename the parameter to avoid the shadowing?  
 use this.values inside a constructor in place of value because the parameter of constructor is string array and you are trying to convert a list  to array.    this.values = ......  
 query dsl is typesafe it's actually one of the main reasons to use querydsl and one of the problems it tries to solve. you create your metamodel and it enables you to effevtively use it with jpa  jdo  sql ..    the reason why you may want to consider to use it instead of the jpa may be the more easier expression construction or that it plays well with spring data. or maybe you want to access a mongodb..    in terms of type safety it doesn't matter which one you use imho. as often the standard (jpa) picks the cherrys from projects (e.g. cdi  jsr  ..)    edit: their own  principles  state type safety is the core principle of querydsl. queries are constructed based on generated query types that reflect the properties of your domain types. also function/method invocations are constructed in a fully type-safe manner.

 i'm not really familiar with android but your java code looks fine.    what response code do you get when you call this:         i was facing some issues with sending a post data some time ago and i found really helpful to know what i'm exactly sending in a http request. you could use  netcat  to display what you are sending to service. fe.          to listen for your requests on port 80 and just send a request to localhost or some other computer in your network that is able to execute such a command. all received requests will be written to your console.    if you will see that the request payload is correct there is probably some problem with webservice that you are trying to call.    edit:    i've tried executing a similar code against netcat and it worked fine.          i got        
 the way i had to solve something similar was to use:     lrucache  that stores the images in memory for quick access     asynctask  to pull the image from the server  scale it to the needed size  add it into the cache  and use the onprogress to update the listview image.  
 to perform a simple redirection  you can inject the   in your controller layer:          and then simply do a redirect using that object:          now - as the luiggi mentions in the comment - i would not do the redirect itself in the service layer  but rather return a boolean which decides if the redirect needs to be done - and then do it here  in the controller layer.     hope it helps.   
 it must be how your server is configured (perhaps you're running in a vm). when i run  on my personal linux laptop          i get         as this machine has four cores. and   reports the same.

 app engine has an api for getting datastore statistics programmatically:         see the documentation:  https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/stats     you can get entities of a kind using    
 change this         to something like         which will work to get the \"user.home\" on every platform that java supports  and then append \"documents/fourletterwords.txt\" to that path.  
 you can either       pass the filename as an parameter    you can load files from the same directory as the .class file with         returns the current directory    
 what they said  plus here's some additional useful tricks for navigating up and down folder levels:       
 in order to just use the file name like \"fourletterwords.txt\" then you will need to move the document 'fourletterwords.txt' to the same file location that your .java / .class files are in.  
 using relative file paths has to do with the path you are currently in. just guessing here  but try \"documents/fourletterwords.txt\".    if that works  the reason is because your current directory is \"c:\\users\\phil\"    if not try         then try moving the file there to be able to use \"fourletterwords.txt\".  
 there are 2 scenarios for file access in java or any programming language:    a. the file is present with in the project directory.   b. file is out of the project directory.      a. file present with in the project directory:      file is present bundled or pushed to folder in project directory. in this case you could use some thing like         the resource folder is child of the root folder of the project.     b. file is present at location out of project directory     you need to have a property set  which will always have the path where you will be having the file. you need to set it as part of the env so that the code will always run on all operating systems. you can also set it as part of the property file which will be changing for each operating system.    getting system variable:      getting property:     
 as you don't have   in your fancyapplet class  so the above error is produced.    you can run your java applet in the netbeans ide by pressing   key from your main class(keeping cursor inside fancyapplet class here). it'll run the applet program without searching for the main method.    this is an alternate shortcut method of running individual classes in netbeans ide.  
 i see from the debug that java does a tls1.2 handshake instead of the more common sslv23 handshake:         the server itself can do only tls1.0 and fails to just announce this older version.  i'm not familiar with java  but you either need set the protocol version to tlsv1 or sslv23 to speak with this server.    the following code would set only tlsv1 with apache httpclient:         edit to include question from comment:        if you say that the server \"fails to just announce this older version\"  does that mean that the server is misconfigured? in this case  why don't firefox&amp;chromium have any problems?       if the client announces tls1.2 in the clienthello and the server can do only tls1.0 it should announce this  i.e. reply with tls1.0. the client can then close the connection if tls1.0 is not good enough or continue with tls1.0. but  in this case the server just told the client that it does not like this version and closed the connection. firefox and others instead do a sslv23 announcement  where they do a tls1.0 handshake but also announce the best protocol version they support. this usually works good for older servers starting from ssl3.0 but also for newer servers.    you can check the behavior of the server with a recent perl/io::socket::ssl and  this script .         here you can see  that the hosts supports sslv23 and tlsv1 handshakes  but not the used tlsv1_2 handshake.  
 httpclient can take an     for its    .    you can set the appropriate tls version in the properties for the   with the   static method.    something like      if you need to force just one protocol (as   can return one that supports multiple protocols)  you can use the   method (which takes a  ) on the   you retrieved using  .  
 booleans help in determining if something is true  in your case used  or false.    assuming you have x and y coordinates  you could have   arrays which represent the status of a coordinate --   = used    = not used; simple enough.         now when you use an index which maps to a coordinate  make it  . when you get random numbers as coordinates  check if they have both been used. if so  that specific coordinate is a duplicate.    to prove for your example in the comment  here's a bit of logical code based on it.             output: i'm still a valid coordinate!      in the code we simulate the situation you've presented by assigning the x/y values of the first two coordinates. then we check if the last one is still valid; indeed it is.  
 you need to compile your source from its root source directory. the relative path to your .java file should be the same as its fully qualified name:         to run it (from the same directory):         if you want to emulate what eclipse is doing - separate directory for source and generated classes:       
 as already said by several users (gassa  shekhar suman  mhum and colonel panic) the problem is solved by finding a topological sorting. as long as the iterator in dag returns the elements in that order it's correct. i don't where the directedacyclicgraph class is from  so i can't help with that. otherwise  this method does the parsing as yours and uses a simple algorithm (actually  the first one springing to my mind)         btw  in your hm array initialization you define it has having 6 elements. it leaves the 0 position null (not a problem since you don't call it anyway) but in the general case the number of tasks could be greater than 5 and then you'll have and indexoutofboundsexception    another punctilious remark  when adding the edges  in case of circular dependencies  if the message of the exception raised by dag is not clear enough  the user could be confused. again  since i don't know where that class is from  i can't know.  
 default value for transactionattribute is required. required is also the default if no transactionattribute annotation is used and the ejb in question uses container managed transactions.  marking the ejb with container transactionmanagementtype means that every method is transactional and by default using required transactionattributetype. you may even skip the transactionmanagement annotation  since container transactionmanagementtype is enabled by default for ejbs. you may use the transactionattribute annotation to override the default.  you may use the transactionattribute annotation either on class or method level or both  in which case method annotation will override class annotation for the specific method.  
 you can always indicate a lambda expression by using a type casting which allows the compiler to infer the functional interface:         however  if you know the signature that well  why would you use reflection? if you want to generate a runtime implementation of an interface  you should implement the interface with a runtime-generated class. look into java proxies or my library  byte buddy  for this. this way  you could supply the argument as follows:       
 you cant create a lambda expression without knowing the target type at compile-time. but you can put the lambdas code into a method and create a method reference to this method. this is similar to how lambda expressions are compiled. the difference is that the functional interface implementation is created explicitly using reflective code:            if you want to implement arbitrary functional signatures (which implies that the implementation is rather trivial  not depending on the unknown parameters)  you can use    . the difference is that the   doesnt need to be  direct  then  i.e. doesnt need to represent a real method. so you can create a  handle invariably returning a constant  and use     to insert additional formal parameters until you have a handle with the right functional signature which you can pass to      
 yes this is because   returns an  . you can call   to get a   and then perform the collect operation.       
 you can change   to   because currently you are passing an array of primitive type( ) but should you pass array of object i.e.      
 you're using an array of primitives for one thing  not  . i suggest you use     like       
 you probably have some buttons in your listview item layout row. because you are writing 'i had this working when it was buttons in a linear layout'.    buttons in row are stealing focus and onitmeclick is not working.    you can make your buttons in row layout not focusable  android.focusable=\"false\"  and this should fix issue with onitemclick not being called  
 you don't need to attach multiple   to the    because a single   will work for all items. just use the   parameter to reference the right object from collection:

 you can extract the zip and copy its content to the project folder. opening compressed files in rar or zip form can cause problems for ides  even for vs when i click on a .sln file contained in rar it first shows but then says it couldn't locate the file  so i just extract it and open it again and the problem is solved.  
     for example  let's assume that i have  enterprise-data-2.4  defined in the dependency management section of server-a.       then you always get 2.4 pulled in  even if there's only jars depending on 1.8 for instance. dependency management overrides dependency mediation.        assuming  server-b  is the only jar pulling in  enterprise-data-2.4   my understanding is that  server-a  will always pull in  enterprise-data-2.4  here. is this correct?      assuming you have no dependency management  then yes. if there are multiple dependencies that are dependent on different versions  then it's a question of which one (and its transitive dependencies) is loaded first  as per the dependency mediation rules for maven version > 2.0.9. others will be: \"managed from x and omitted for duplicate\".        when i run my tests in  test-b  should i get errors while attempting to access functionality present in  enterprise-data-3.0  since it's not being pulled in by  server-a  or will it pass because there is a test dependency on  enterprise-data-3.0 ? it passes currently but i am not sure how a test dependency is sufficient.      if it's pulling the wrong version with incompatible code  yes you will see errors. for maven 3  defining a test scope dependency with 3.0 and compile scope dependency with 2.4 will mean that maven overrides the 2.4 and goes with the newer one defined on test scope. see  this question and its answers  for more details.    nevertheless  you can always use dependency management in  test-b  to fix in the version of each dependency that you want to use.  
 you should move your loadphonemembers() method to a new thread since it is a time consuming process that is blocking the ui thread. for example  you could create a class that extends   and move this code to the   method of this class. here is the documentation:  http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/asynctask.html     note that you can not make changes to the user interface from a background thread  
 eclipse is kind of stupid right now (there's probably a bug open).     you have a lambda expression in here           is declared as throwing a checked exception. but    which is the functional interface method you're implementing  does not. eclipse is stupid in that it recommends that you wrap the statement in a try block  but it adds the try block around the whole thing         when in reality it should be adding it to the body of the lambda         this seems to happen when your lambda body is a simple expression rather than a block.  
 you need to handle   which can be thrown as a result of   . you can surround the code within         
 from the name \"sqoop import\" it sounds like the tool is only used for reading?    perhaps you can try confusing it by renaming your table  and then creating a view with the same name as the table. in the view you can alias your columns without spaces.         the you can write your query like this...         at best this is a last resort workaround  and it might not work if the application tries to update the view.    worth a shot.  
 i am implementing this in java. the solution i found is the following pattern...         this pattern will match a record (substring of larger string) consisting of 3 bracketed sections containing any number of characters followed by any number of characters except for a bracket (indicating a new record)    thanks for the help.  
 you should have kept reading  it's the reference that's added to the   list as discussed in the section titled  :        here's the culprit:           and further on         update : as of java 1.7 update 6  string behaviour has changed so that taking a substring doesn't hold on to the original byte array. that's a bit of a blow to my contrived example  but the overall approach to finding the issue still holds.    
 the choice between serializing using java or xml doesn't depend on where you'd like to serialize it to.  both can be saved to a file.  java serialization dependent on the fact that every process reading the file is a java program.  (nothing besides a java program could read that format.)  xml however is about interoperability.  any type of program can read an xml file and load in that data through some sort of library (jaxb or other non-java xml serialization libraries).    maintaining compatibility of serialized java objects can be troublesome as the class changes  but it's not insurmountable.  i don't try it though.  if that were a factor for you  you might want to consider xml even if only java programs were going to read it.    so the issue is -- who needs to read the data you're writing  and what are your needs for writing it in the first place?  
 i think the best way is the serialization  you can write down the object you want and easily read it:       here  an useful example    here  the official docs form oracle      serialize person p:         deserialize person p:       
 the solution to to make a list of the indexes that match and populate it in your for loop.    then after the for loop is done  print out the results         this will print out   with a trailing comma.  it's slightly more complicated to not have a trailing comma at the last index but i will leave that up to you to figure out.  
 you can also use stringbuilder if all you care is to output the indexes.       
 if i understand correctly the problem is the following:    you have elements in an array  you want to check if a particular value is in more than once position of the array  your problem is if you simply remove the break statement  it shows a message every time you don't find the desired number  that's frankly the only problem i see with removing the break statement.    personally  what i'd do one of these two things:    option a: you can create a boolean variable that changes if you find a number  then wait to deliver the \"array not found\" message until you have stopped searching for it  like this:         println does the same as print  only it introduces a \  at the end  so the response looks like this:    array 2 found at index :0    array 2 found at index :2    instead of:    array 2 found at index :0 array 2 found at index :2    option b: probably more elegant solution would be to create other array that store the positions in which you have found the element you are looking for  then print them all at once  you could do this going over the array twice (one to count how many positions the array has to have  another to check the positions of the elements) or simply use an arraylist  but since this looks like learning material i'm going to guess that's out of the question.    also if it is possible  try to word your question better because i'm still not even sure if this is what you are asking.  
 you can't run a   file. right click on    and then select \"run as > java application\". of course  you'll need to fix the compiler errors (the red x) that are displayed under the   tab in your screen shot. unfortunately  we can't see those errors. the code posted above         is fine  so   must have some other code in it.  
 firstly  your class createprofile doesn't implement the actionlistener so you can't use         you have to make new object your private class which implement actionlistener for example:         additionaly class buttonevent should implement actionperformed instead of action method and the getactioncommand() returns button's title instead of \"jb\".    your buttonevent should look like:         and don't forget about show your window using setvisible(true) in createprofile constructor.    edit: if you want to have multiple user profiles you can make list and add new objects to that list. for example in createprofile class add:         and add new users         instead of userprofile u1 = new userprofile(fn ln g ht); in buttonevent.  
 you can try make a \"create\" method:         and use it:       
 for a scenario like this  the  composite pattern  and the  visitor pattern  come to mind.  the latter  specifically  will allow to separate the structure of your tree from the traversal of the tree.  
 this is your issue:         should be:         the last two parameters of a rectangle are width and height. here we give the rectangle a width and a height of 1 pixel but you can set it to whatever you like. you were setting those parameters as the inputs x and y which are different every time giving you varying results.     edit:  to translate the input coordinates to your game world's coordinates based on the camera you have to do this:         when you use camera.unproject(vector) it translates your inputs coordinates to work based off of where your camera is positioned in the game world. so now we're using a vector clickpos.     the reason we use a vector3 is because this is what is required by the unproject function. we supply this vector with the inputs x and y but give it a 0 for the third parameter z since this is a 2d world.  
   is a   that writes to the standard output. you need to create a   and decorates it with   (or better   with  ):             also see:        which is the best way to create file and write to it in java.

 in the second   block  you're splitting on    but you have no guarantee the string contains that substring  because all you checked was whether the string contained  .  
 when regular expressions    means any character and if you split on   it will not do what you expect.  i suggest trying   which means   literally.

 i was able to make this error go away by searching through the application context xml (which was huge for my app) for all references to jacksonjaxbjsonprovider. i saw that 2 separate beans were defined as using this class. i removed one of them and added the singleton attribute to the one i kept...         hope this helps someone.  
 the  documentation of    says:        each httpurlconnection instance is used to make a single request but   the underlying network connection to the http server may be   transparently shared by other instances.      this means that you cannot create a new (post) request on the same   object. and indeed  you get an   from it.    so you should remove the   modifier from the definition of    and then  after finishing with the processing of the output of the original (get) request  create another connection:         only then  you can continue with constructing your post request.       a little note: you use try-with-resources  so you don't need to explicitly close your streams. also  you don't need two   blocks. in fact  you don't need to keep a reference to the    as   also closes the underlying    which also closes the underlying  .  
   returns  a constructorargumentsverification object  that powermock  wants you to call .         the inverse order works only because powermock can only detect that your syntax is wrong the next time you interact with powermock  mockito  or a mock. when your   comes first  powermock gets called in the subsequent   and figures out something's wrong. this code would also produce the same exception:         catching unfinished verification and stubbing like these is part of the reason that it makes sense to call     in an   method (or    which does the same thing outside of powermock)  but i don't know if it would catch the powermock problem here.  
 the   is the correct line ending for unix. it's windows that uses   as a line ending (with the   or carriage return symbol) that looks like ^m. you can use     to get the correct line-ending for your system. you can also use   to remove dos formatted newlines from text files.  
     why do you not need to call the yield or sleep method in any of the threads?      scheduling is done pre-emptively.  you don't need to call yield or sleep or wait or call a blocking operation for the os to suspend you thread.        i was under the assumption that if two threads are of the same priority  one will finish before the other is started on a single core system.       even if one thread is maximum priority and one is the lowest priority  it doesn't mean one will finish before the other.        unless you call one of the control functions ie.) yield() sleep() join()       calling these methods can give up the cpu but this doesn't mean the os won't suspect a thread because these were not called.  note: they don't have to.  
 have you looked at messageformat ( http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/messageformat.html )?  
 according to  microsoft    ado.net is a set of classes that expose data access services for .net framework programmers. ado.net provides a rich set of components for creating distributed  data-sharing applications. it is an integral part of the .net framework  providing access to relational  xml  and application data. ado.net supports a variety of development needs  including the creation of front-end database clients and middle-tier business objects used by applications  tools  languages  or internet browsers.     given that  the answer is no. java does not and cannot natively integrate with any .net framework (there are third-party commercial libraries that enable it  but they're typically non-trivial to work with). instead java uses jdbc to perform database operations in a vendor neutral cross-platform way.  
 indeed jackson will override jsoncreator method with constructor method in case if parameter is java standard type. i would say this is a bug in basicdeserializerfactory#_handlesingleargumentconstructor method.     so  the problem is that constructor has higher priority then static factory method in case if that constructor and static factory method has regular java type. there is few ways how to workaround it.    set creator visibility level to non_private:         second way is to delete static factory method and use constructor. i moved preconditions.checkargument to the constructor (it doesn't do much... just throw an illegalargumentexception if condition is not satisfied):         another way is to use @jsonignore annotation but you mention that you don't like this approach :)     update  i've logged a bug:  https://github.com/fasterxml/jackson-databind/issues/660      update  jackson bug that prefers constructor over static factory method was resolved:  https://github.com/fasterxml/jackson-databind/commit/257ae1c7a88c5ccec2882433a39c0df1de2b73aa   
 from  the documentation :         number : if the count of letters is one  then the value is output using the minimum number of digits and without padding.       so the format specifier you want is    using single letter forms. of course  it will still parse date  s like   correctly as for these day/month values  two digits are the minimum number of digits.    the important difference is that   and   require zero padding  not that   and   cant handle values greater than 9 (that would be a bit unusual).  
 it is possible to include multiple format patterns that are going to be checked automatically.         the  documentation  states:        when parsing  the first parser in the list is selected for parsing. if   it fails  the next is chosen  and so on. if none of these parsers   succeeds  then the failed position of the parser that made the   greatest progress is returned.    
 you should create configuration that does a couple of things      enable the security   enable security for the frontend   enable security for the backend      basically those are 3 different parts of configuration which all require their respective   class.    something like the following should work.         you probably need to tune the   
 you can do this in java.         this is quite a bit faster as it memory maps the file and avoids a memory copy (you can do the same in c++)  
 the java standard is very precise about how floating points are to be represented:          java virtual machine specification 2.3.2:   the floating-point types are float and double  which are conceptually associated with the   32-bit single-precision and 64-bit double-precision format ieee 754   values and operations as specified in ieee standard for binary   floating-point arithmetic (ansi/ieee std. 754-1985  new york).      but the c++ standard doesn't give many guarantees regarding this:           c++11 standard 3.9.1/8:  there are three floating point types: float  double  and long double. the type double provides at least as much precision as   float  and the type long double provides at least as much precision as   double.  (...) the value representation of floating-point types is    implementation-defined .      with     you can in a portable way know a little bit more about your floats:    will for example tell you if the  iec-559 / ieee-754 standard (aka the same as java) is used:       if it is   you could then read the float  using binary data as it is      if not  you'll have to read the bytes and write floating point format conversion routines  which usually proves to be challenging.      
 this turned out be because i was using an old version of the maven pmd plugin.   the maven plugin pulls in pmd by itself  which is convenient  but doesn't give you any control over what version it pulls in.    the version i was using  2.7.1  pulled in pmd version 4.3  which did not have the rule i was trying to include. therefore  it (correctly) stated that it couldn't find that rule.    the current version of the maven pmd plugin  3.3  pulls in pmd version 5.2.1  which does include the   jsp-checking rule.       once i updated the maven pmd plugin to version 3.3  everything worked:

 you have chosen to add text using pdf syntax at the lowest level. this means that you need to calculate the length of every single piece of text that you are adding to your document  and then distribute the text by adding it in different   sequences  making sure to adjust the coordinates correctly.    that is hard.    however  you have also chosen to use itext  which means that you can have itext do this work for you. for instance: if you want to add a snippet of text inside a specific rectangle  then you can define a   object  define a    add the text as a   and  !         now the text   will be wrapped inside a rectangular area defined by the coordinates llx = 36  lly = 600  urx = 200  ury = 800. the   variable will give you an indication whether or not the text was fully rendered (or if it didn't fit completely).    further reading:       itext string fitting     how can i truncate text within a bounding box?     separating redundant code from pdf generator function    ...      if this example helps you  please help me understand what i can do to make sure that other developers do not make the same mistake you made  and explain what made you write the code you wrote instead of trying   first. your information will help me  in writing a better book.

 you shouldn't speed up or slow down your loop for testing - instead design the loop to explicitly synchronize with your test code (e.g. through a countdownlatch or a condition).  test code that relies on speed of execution of the code under test is inherently flaky and you  will  see problems.  
     does anyone know if i should be concerned with the overhead of resuming/pausing a java thread at very rapid intervals when using thread.sleep()       possibly. sleeping gives up the cpu and there is no guarentee it will wake promptly.  it might take 11 or 15 ms in rare cases.  after waking up  you cpu will run slower for about 200 micro-seconds while the cpu cache warms up again.        is there another alternative i should be looking at?       don't sleep ever. it costs more but your code won't slow down.        for starters i don't see another option other than thread.sleep()       there is locksupport.park(nanos) which has more precision.        hope this makes sense!      i would sleep by the length of time between quote updates as it occurred originally.  i would put an upper limit on this like 10 to 100 ms depending on your use case.  if you want to be precise  you can busy wait for the delay you need.  
 sounds like you may have multiple producers and multiple consumers  each on its own thread. if so you may throttle down the number of them thru config injection. this way you may always have 1 producer  1 consumer. if your producer is created within test code then you should have no problems throttling it and by doing so you throttle the whole system. you can use   or sync primitives.    however if the goal of your testing is actually to figure out what consumer does with data then what i do is actually exposing the method that does work so that i can call it directly and only once with predefined data. if this method is in some sort of endless loop then in normal scenario it presumably will wait for data to come after it's done with processing. but in test mode only  useful  part of the loop will be run. the biggest downside is exposing a method that you may not want to expose otherwise.       
 only by making your own custom rom mod  containing your own custom build of android. sdk applications cannot modify the settings app. also  your app's daemon will never run  because nothing exists on the device that would start it.  
 hm  judging based on \"icon\" being called \"logo\" etc i bet you got not much experience with the platform  but yes  you can have app not listed but that's usually implies certain other limitations as well. so \"choose right tool for the task\" case here. if you want to run in fully \"stealath\" mode you need to be system app which means you need to have own rom as well as no external app can be system app on most devices (rooted is the exception but that's other story)  
 your code is creating a pipedinputstream which is not connected to anything and will never get any data. for reading from stdin  you don't need to create a new stream; you should just read from system.in.

 you're attempting to use the   pseudoselector in your css selector. this pseudoselector is not a part of any published css standard. unfortunately  it's become common since the javascript css selector engine implementation used by jquery ( sizzle ) allows it to be used. since the driver implementations rely on the browsers' native css selector engine implementations  they don't support the   pseudoselector  and throw the exception you're seeing. also  i note that you're attempting to find the check box where the name attribute (not the element content) contains the string for which you're searching. in that case   wouldn't work anyway.    leaving aside the inherent instability of finding elements using the text contained within them  if you really want to do that  finding by xpath is likely your only option. also  the check box element is not a descendent of the element containing the text you're looking for. rather  it's a sibling element  and css selectors don't permit you to walk up the dom tree to parent elements. again  this is a feature best handled by xpath.    i'd handle the issue using something like the following:         note carefully that this solution performs two finds. doing so in two steps gives you the opportunity to  perform other actions related to the cell containing your value if needed. otherwise  you could use a single xpath expression like this:

 according to  this excelent answer :        in the @postconstruct (as with the afterpropertiesset from the initializingbean interface) there is no way to ensure that all the post processing is already done  so (indeed) there can be no transactions.      as i see  you do not need a transaction nor an entity manager bean  but rather an entity manager factory bean. i think you should simply autowire the entitymanagerfactory and then unwrap the hibernate sessionfactory from it.       
 i think i figured it out.    since jruby-complete dependency is brining in apache-commons-logging jar  i used the following statements in the ruby script and it logged it to the configured webservice log       
 i just noticed that i was able to use slf4j too      the logging level depends on what we set at the root level in config.yaml. only if that is set to debug  we can see log.debug entries.      i also noticed configuring log level at the package/class level  does not log debug statements from ruby    
 i see two issues with the snippet you posted. the first one you are using the  outer  iterator also int inner loop         i do think you should use    in place of   in the second loop.     second you are not using the remove method from the iterator interface to remove the item from your collection. from the  doc         the iterators returned by this class's iterator and listiterator   methods are fail-fast: if the list is structurally modified at any   time after the iterator is created  in any way except through the   iterator's own remove or add methods  the iterator will throw a   concurrentmodificationexception. thus  in the face of concurrent   modification  the iterator fails quickly and cleanly  rather than   risking arbitrary  non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time   in the future.    
 as you can tell  using nested iterators can lead to mixups in using the wrong one  etc. another approach to doing this without iterators is to keep track of the ones you want to remove while iterating  then remove them after. this approach does require temporary collections  but allows you to use the foreach loop and prevent errors with using the wrong iterators.       
 this is a classpath issue  you can try the following:         other option would be to use manifest file:       
 package your jar with a manifest file in the meta-inf directory (at root level in the jar file). in the manifest add an entry to specify the main class to execute:     where classname is the full class name including the package. when packaged you can run the main class with the command  .   you do not have to specify the class name on the command line. easier for anybody that could use your jar file.  
 there is no  stable  api for building rules from java code. there is  of course  an api for the drl compiler's parser  but it isn't stable and as complex as drl rule syntax  which is considerable.    xml was an option where at least left hand side syntax was simple enough  which ended with 5.2 (iirc). now you can use java's full expression syntax and more  combined with the many varied ways to compose ces.    if your rules are exceptionally simple  you might come up with a model for rules that could be manipulated with a manageable api. otherwise  your best bet is a text editor (or  of course  the kie workbench).  
 the built-in way to programmatically create rules is based on a \"descr\" fluent api  which manipulates the compiler's ast directly  bypassing the parser.    see the class      and the class   to retrieve a drl approximation from the ast.  
 the problem is you're using a postfilter - aggregation works on the results returned by the query  the postfilter is occurring too late.    to get your filter to work  use a filtered query (this is probably the one you want) or include a filter as part of the aggregation.    this page on  filtering queries and aggregations  has everything in it you need.  
 download and use the arm version of the emulator image.  
   from java doc          public static path createtempfile(string prefix                      string suffix                      fileattribute... attrs)                              throws ioexception         creates an empty file in the default temporary-file directory  using the given prefix and   suffix to generate its name. the resulting path is associated with the   default filesystem. this method works in exactly the manner specified   by the createtempfile(path string string fileattribute[]) method for   the case that the dir parameter is the temporary-file directory.      your   is not file name but prefix to your temporary file  
 its the random number of long type that's generated by jdk. its generated as follows:         as per the javadocs  it says:    once these adjustments have been      * made the name of the new file will be generated by concatenating the      * prefix   five or more internally-generated characters   and the suffix.

 i would suggest you to use an object mapper like jackson or gson to convert between json and your object and not do it manually.  
   takes a  . you'll want to use   as that comparison function.         you were providing   as an implementation of  . that method doesn't match the requirements of  . instead of returning a value indicating which is biggest  it returns the value of the biggest.  
 you need to invoke map on  intstream          currently your code just returns the first value from the list i.e.   in your case

 com/sun/tools/xjc/options.class is in the jar  jaxb-xjc.jar that comes with the jaxb distribution. normally  javax.xml.bind and the xjc tool are available via jdk and the java binaries. but  if some application needs to call the xml schema compiler via its api  the individual classes contained in that jar must be available.  
 you're just not giving it enough time to complete.  if you want to execute this serially you would need 1000 * 100 milliseconds  which is 100 seconds.  you are running it with four threads  so divide that by 4 and you get 25 seconds.  you only wait 10 seconds to complete.  increase that to 26 seconds just to be safe and you should see your result.    the   will wait the   number of seconds to complete  if it doesn't complete it will simply return out and continue the execution.  to prove my point check the return value       the better solution here  is to use a    have each runnable task   after it adds to the list and finally have the main thread   completion.  
 the documentation of executorservice.shutdown says the following:        initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously submitted tasks are   executed  but no new tasks will be accepted. invocation has no   additional effect if already shut down.        this method does not wait for previously submitted tasks to complete   execution. use awaittermination to do that.      this means that you indicate your executorservice that it must stop it's services. thus  this method sets a flag which indicates that the executorservice will end soon  which allows the main thread to returns from this method without problems.    executorservice.awaittermination  moreover  reads as follows:        blocks until all tasks have completed execution after a shutdown   request  or the timeout occurs  or the current thread is interrupted    whichever happens first.      this means that the main thread will be blocked inside the method  where it will only be returned when the tasks sent to executorservice finish. in both cases  the developer intends to end the executorservice function. but with awaittermination  the developer is saying executorservice should be terminated regardless of their tasks have been carried out or not.    as each task takes at least 100 milliseconds to complete  no one will possibly be completed because executorservice has a tolerance of only 10 milliseconds for completion of all it's tasks.    there is no point in calling shutdown and awaittermination at the same time (or preceded by another). according to your code  shutdown has no effect. if you want your tasks to become completed  and that executorservice is terminated without caring if your main thread will continue  just use shutdown. if you do not want your main thread to be blocked  and simply want to end with executorservice  use shutdownnow.    if  on the other hand  you want your main thread to wait for the execution of your tasks without a certain time to be specified  you may have to use java synchronizers. some of java synchronizers are as follow:      latches   futuretasks   semaphores   barriers      for your case  i believe you can use  countdownlatch . make a new countdownlatch object have the number of tasks running on your executorservice. as they are completed  the count is decreased  and so  your main thread can expect completion and continue after all.    i hope you have understood and you can do what you want. if you have further questions  the documentation of countdownlatch demonstrates perfectly how you can synchronize tasks. good luck.  
 in that code snippet one issue will be there.         here it will wait for 10 seconds after that it will break.    you will try following snippet.

 looks like  http://wicket.apache.org/guide/guide/nativewebsockets.html#nativewebsockets_6  (the faq). websocket communication is not intercepted by servlet filters so di frameworks like cdi  spring and guice have no chance to prepare their scoped beans. in your case requestscoped. you can use only application and prototype scoped beans.  
 clean solution: ejb instead of cdi. ejb @asynchronous works with websockets.    add the following line in init() of webapplication extended class:         inject ejb in webpage extended class:         insert in web.xml (or would get a weird persistence error in wildfly)         and dependencies for wicketstuff-javaee-inject ( http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.wicketstuff/wicketstuff-javaee-inject )    repository quickstart  https://github.com/claudiu-stanciu/wicketcdi_test/tree/ejb_test   
 edit: ok  here is a solution that will work for complex shapes          explanation: when   is called if creates a temporary array of booleans to work with so the original board is not messed up. then it searches the entire board for \"trues\" (which correspond to '1's on the board). every time a \"true\" is found  a flood fill algorithm clears the entire shape to which it is connected. if you need more performance and less memory usage (specially stack) for larger boards  you can use another flood fill algorithm like in the example that follows. the big advantage here is that it doesn't use the stack for every pixel like the one above. it is considerably more complex though.          edit2: both solutions were made using input from txt files in order to make the debugging and testing easier for larger arrays. if you need them to work with user input (the same you have in your code) as well  just make the following changes:       change the   method so it will listen from user input (again):            add a new constructor to board2  that takes a string[] as input:              you may remove the previous constructor   if it is not useful for you but it's not necessary.  
 are you searching for this:       
 there's a linear  time (in number of cells) solution to this. if i get time  i'll add the code to this answer  but if not the wikipedia article (see edit below) gives pseudo code.    the idea is to scan line-by-line  assigning an incrementing unique run numbers to each runs of 1s we see (and changing the cell content to be that unique number) if in any run  the cells immediately above in the previous line were also 1 (that is  they now have a run number)  then we know that their unique-run-number and the current unique-run number form part of a single block. so record that the run-above-run-number  and the current-run-number are equivalent (but don't bother to change anything on the board)    at the end  we have a count of the runs we've seen. and a set of equivalence relationships of unique-run-numbers. for each set of equivalent-numbers (say runs 3  5  14 form a block)  we subtract from the run count the number of runs  minus 1 (in other words  replacing the multiple runs with a single block count).    i think i have some ideas to mitigate the worst case  but they're probably not worth it.    and that's the number of blocks.    the worst case for the equivalence classes is o(size of board) though (1-wide vertical blocks  with one space between them will do this). fortunately  the entirely-black board will need only o(height of board) - each row will get one number  which will be marked equivalent with the next row.    edit:  there's a stackoverflow question about this already:  can counting contiguous regions in a bitmap be improved over o(r * c)?     and it turns out i've just re-invented the two-pass \"connected component labelling\" algorithm discussed on  wikipedia   
 you need to define the size as a   by using the   suffix:         the problem is that by default  numeric literals are of   type and 50g is outside of its range  so the result of the multiplication overflows. the actual value passed to the   is  .    in more detail  the result type of multiplication (as well as other numeric operations) is defined by the most general of its operands  so you don't actually need to add the   suffix to every one of them. it is sufficient to add it to only just of them (the first one is a sensible choice):       
 better to move your initialization code to some method ( ) which you will call from constructor  as well from every other place where you need it.    constructors shouldn't be considered as being like any other method. their purpose is to create new instances of the class  so calling one from that object's method can't result in changing the caller's instance variables.  
 check if you have a crazy_tip_calc.xml in res/menu folder.    after this  try a project>clean  
 in this line of code:         you are not copying the list  but creating another reference to it.    to make a shallow copy of the list you can use for example:   constructor which accepts   as a parameter and makes copy.    so it should be like that:       
   does not create a new object but it just points on the   object. you could use  . this one will instatiate a new object arraylist and it will not effect your static list object.      however   keep in mind that any change on your object   will be applied on both on your lists too  because both objects inside those two lists are pointing on the same adress. so if you want to apply individual  changes to your objects inside your    you should create new   objects as well. you might want to take a look at  deep and shallow copy .  
 take a look at valuemetafactory  there are methods in there to retrieve valuemeta types by name or integer type:     https://github.com/pentaho/pentaho-kettle/blob/master/core/src/org/pentaho/di/core/row/value/valuemetafactory.java#l133   
 to me  this is very much about choosing good names that clearly convey the idea of the mutation. naming is one of the hardest problems in programming.    i could understand a few argument-less mutators  e.g.         on the other hand    would be a confusing mutator name to me: it shows that a side effect is expected  but does not describe an internal change  if any.  
 in all likelihood  this isn't a software issue  nor is it fixable with software. your screen probably only refreshes about 60 times a second  meaning that the frames are only drawn 60 times per second  or once every (approximately) 16 milliseconds. since this is a hardware barrier  there's no way to get it to update faster with software. you can probably count on your users only having 60hz monitors  too  so it's more worthwhile to look into other solutions.    one solution that pops to mind is adding in motion blur  to make it seem like the ships are moving faster when they really aren't. it'll allow you to 'jump' a greater distance before it looks jumpy  since the blur tricks the eye into thinking it's going really fast instead of hopping across the screen. unfortunately  the only things that i see to do motion blur are third-party libraries  though you may have better luck googling.  
 i advise you that you change your swing engine for javafx (at least)  a technology with better performance and more tools to your disposal. swing nowadays is considered a dead technology  as well as with the awt before it. a great place to study and start javafx would be this one:     http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javase-clienttechnologies.htm     the ideal for the development of games  would be to use a library prepared for it  such as libgdx:     http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/     but if your desire is to create a game in swing  who am i to judge? sometimes it is good to see old things. i myself still like swing  even being obsolete compared to other things.    i think you may be implementing a wrong gameloop. swing timer does not really seem like a good way to update game logic. even with different settings between different computers  is generally practical and easy to implement a gameloop to work properly  especially for the correct movement of the characters.    you see  a gameloop is the heart of a game  and needs to be implemented straight otherwise the game is developed wrong and with several  limitations . generally  in gameloop we have to take into account the desired fps. among game updates  we must take the time elapsed between the last update and the current update  so-called delta by many developers. you will find many materials about it on the internet  which i recommend:     http://dewitters.koonsolo.com/gameloop.html      http://www.java-gaming.org/index.php?topic=21919.0      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dzhgsvaiso     the past links will help you for sure  but if you want more about it  i recommend that you take a look at this book:     http://www.brackeen.com/javagamebook/     even the material being old (as swing is) you'll find details of how to implement a good gameloop with a keyboard and mouse iinput system  sound  the use of the best possible performance swing has to offer  among other cool things. and one more thing... to give you a better result with respect to the movement of the characters  i advice you to use position variables (x and y) with decimal types such as float or double.    i hope you can do what you want. good luck!  
 actually this surprised me a lot.    i went to their repository to see actually what the hell is that. so i found that they add some methods but hide it in the documentation using @hide javadoc annotation until it's fully tested or until they remember to unhide it.        @hide when applied to a package  class  method or field  @hide removes   that node and all of its children from the documentation.      so to know the truth the  tolongarray()  method was actually added in a  commit  more than 3 years and 10 months ago and actually they unhide it 1 year  7 months ago in this  commit .  
 according to the information i suggest the following half solution:         it will replace all double quotes with escaped qutoes and then evaluates the whole thing as into a gstring. this should work  as long as no double quotes are used in the value parts. gstring can be used then for the sql. this solution is basically the same as the first two evaluate examples in groovy-2505. the important point missed by marshall is obviously that we need to wrap the string contents in quotes. a /\"str\"/ will of course just produce a string \"str\". if str is for example select  then this would produce \"str\". what we want is '\"'+str+'\"'  which will give \"select\". it does have to be  double quotes  because we want the eval call to evaluate the gstring parts  which is not available in a single quoted string.  
 i'd probably select the items in one go.    something like this pseudocode:       
 you could do something like this i think       
 easiest way to do is using a map containing the number and a list of indexes.         iterate through the list updating the maximum &amp; storing its index.    -> if same maximum value is met again  add its index also to the list.  -> if new maximum is found  update the number from the map.  
 just a quick code from my mind:         let me know if this doesn't work!  
 a lot of things can be done in one single line with java 8:         note : this is my code for the class         
 a good solution (because of library being included in jdk since java 1.7) is to use the fxcanvas from javafx ( http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/embed/swt/fxcanvas.html )  which could be embedded in swt components structure. javafx provides drawing methods that use double as coordinates instead of int.  
 you might try configuring session persistence.  here  is a blog on how to do it.         however  it seems that this feature is available startinng from v8.2. i'll quote a note from this blog        you can also achieve session passivation  when you are using a non-ha profile  by adding   to your web.xml (for those using wildfly 8.1.0 or less).    
 check by parsing string to int          
 firstly as pointed out   is used in java to convert from   to  . secondly you need to have a extra variable to store and accumulate the total of positive numbers too. i have added a   exception block to handle errors.    here is a code for reference.          output if there are no errors       
 hope the below code achieves what you want to do       
 create a list and keep adding the numbers into list. you should do something like:         and then use for loop to do count like:       
 try using   to get an   from your string    and checking to see if the integer is   (negative) or   (positive)  
 i have added an extra variable called   to assist with the   calculation.    in order to perform this calculation  you need to ensure the value is an   so i have added the parse statement.       
 change your   loop: it is using  strings   not  integers :         also  you need to   the   utility:         don't use a    but use:         also  you would want to use a checker for your positive and negative numbers inside your   loop:         i've also added a   statement to handle an error if someone doesn't enter an  :         i added a little bit of code that takes the   off when it prints the numbers  as i realise it will include   when you type it in to exit. change your   statement to    it's just programming:         also  i add a negative-number counter in the main code  and an averager. here is the complete code  to avoid confusion:         hope it helps! ote i have trial-tested it  and it works brilliantly. if you have any errors with this please tell me :)  
       edit :     firt solution :         second solution :       
 i think you just made a typo  as you already said in your question: i get a list of objects (of type classsection). that's clear because you print the list of objects.    if you want to do it in the while loop (print immediately the value for every result)  just change the last line in the loop to:         if you want to print the values of all results (after all results are processed)  just add michaël's solution after the wile loop.  
 the settings app is built as part of a full firmware build. the settings app is not an android sdk application and therefore is not subject to the limitations imposed by the android sdk  such as not having access to   classes and methods.  
 i saw this line in the  hs_err_pid failed to write core dump. call to minidumpwritedump() failed i would suggest investigating and fixing this problem first - i.e so that the entire details of the core dump are written out. that would give more information about the reason for the crash. also do you have the tomcat apr native connector set up? if not  that might be one reason for the entire core dump not getting written out.

 a comment suggested a system property so i looked at the list of those - it turns out there is one that gives this value:       
 there is no casting going on here.    as you say    is a base class of  .  this means that every instance of   is also an    and we can always treat it as one.         the opposite relation does not hold  however - not all instances of   are  s.    after you have assigned the   to    the information that it's  actually  a   is unavailable to the compiler.  that information is available at runtime - you can say   and it will  be true - but the compiler does not know that.   
      you can't have   obviously     unless the dog is also a student  but that's a different story.  
       upcasting : we're narrowing the reference conversion (moving up the inheritance hierarchy). since a student   object  it does not require an explicit cast     downcasting : we're are widening the reference conversion (moving down the inheritance hierarchy). since object could be anything  we must use an explicit cast to cast it to a student.   
 java only allows implicit upcasting  not implicit downcasting.    upcasting in java is also called widening conversion  and downcasting is called narrowing conversion.    objects can be implicitly or explicitly cast to a supertype. in this example    is a supertype of  .         objects cannot be implicitly cast to a subtype  and must be explicitly cast. in this example    is a subtype of  .          explicit and implicit type casting - herong yang      5.1.5. widening reference conversion - java docs      5.1.6. narrowing reference conversion - java docs   
 you need to explicitly cast this to student         the reason for this is because the compiler doesn't know if this is correct  so you need to cast this as if to say  \"i am confident that this will work. please trust me\" .  
 you can assign the instance of student to a variable declared to be of type object  because every student is a kind of (or specialization of) object. since not every object is a student  the compiler balks at the assignment of something it knows only to be an instance of object to any specialization of object  such as student. so  you can assign to an instance variable of a more general type implicitly without difficulty  but in the opposite direction the compiler wants some assurance that you mean to do this  so you explicitly downcast.         this is simply the nature of a statically typed language.  
 you basically have to see if it passes the   test  you can say   (as every class in java is a subclass of class object) which is why the first implicit cast works.    however you cannot say an   because it might not be. unless you know for a fact that it will be a   then you can do a  downcast  with:         just in case you make a mistake with that  downcast  though  you might want to wrap it in an if statement like so:       
 here it is an url where they explain how to solve your problem     http://www.jade-cheng.com/uh/ta/signed-applet-tutorial/   
 instead of creating a new context on the listener  implement the interface  applicationcontextaware   your context will be injected.  
 if you are using spring 3 or higher:        as of spring 3.0  an applicationlistener can generically declare the   event type that it is interested in. when registered with a spring   applicationcontext  events will be filtered accordingly  with the   listener getting invoked for matching event objects only.       http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/applicationlistener.html#onapplicationevent-e-     which would look like the following. note also that this solution will ensure it is only executed on this event (i.e. start/load): it looks to me like even if you inject the context to your original class it would be executed for any event.         see examples here:     http://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring/event_handling_in_spring.htm   
 this says that the type of   is  . there are probably easier ways to demonstrate it.   yields the classsymbol.

 i wouldn't use   outside of an auto-configuration class if i were you  unless you can control the order of import of   classes. auto-configuration does it explicitly  but normal user config classes (especially if they are  ) do not have a defined order.  
 the real problem is with indices in your obj file.    every attribute: pos  normal  texcoord use separate indexing.     so your faces specify which index should be used for every attribute separately on each of its 3 vertices.    you need to rearrange normals and texcoords so their indices will match vertex position indices.    simplest solution is to allocate new array (not indexed with vertices count = 3 * face count) and fill it manually looking up attributes from indexed data.    then you can draw it using drawarrays (instead of drawelements)         you need to convert to:         in following way:

 you seem to have a default   which cannot parse the english  . use the  overloaded   constructor  which accepts a   and provide it with an appropriate instance.       
 your exception never gets caught  so that's why your application is crashing.    you can do this do catch the exception from your main thread:         but you can also run the code from your main thread and catch it there.. like:         because your exception is extended from the   class the default behaviour is to exit the application if the exception is not catched anywhere. so that's why you should catch it before the java runtime decides to quit the app.   
 you are using exception to create logs. you shouldnt do that. if you are using a library like crashlytics ( https://try.crashlytics.com/ ) you can send log reports like in this link:  http://support.crashlytics.com/knowledgebase/articles/120066-how-do-i-use-logging     the library you are using should have a similar method.     if you want to continue to use exceptions  you need to catch them to not crash the application.  
 http header values can be us-ascii characters only.    you can url-encode characters outside this range  thereby only sending allowed characters.  
 look for something like jscrollpane mypane = new jscrollpane();  
 what you are trying to do is tricky because any array (except an array of primitives) is an    so as you have noticed  the method will always accept any array and any object.     one way around this could be to pass an explicit   object  like this         then you could write          but not       
 you can't.    or put another way   any  array and  any  reference already satisfy your requirement  \"array of type x and another varable with the same type as the array\"  because  any  array is an \"array of type  \"  and  any  reference is of the same type ( ).    what you want serves no  type-safety  purpose. consider  hypothetically  that there were a language feature to do what you want. it can only operate on the compile-time types of the expressions of the arguments. but someone can always do this:         or         (and  by the way  neither of these are doing anything fishy or unsafe. an upcast is always 100% safe and legit operation in java.)    so any array and any reference can always be passed to your function anyway  and your function always needs to handle the actual objects being any type of array and any type object anyway. so your feature achieves nothing.    even if you restrict it to be subtypes of some type    and your function only takes   and    it can still always be the case that the  actual runtime class  of the objects pointed to by the references passed in are   and    where   and   are unrelated subtypes of  . this is just a fact of how the java type system works. so your function will always have to deal with the runtime component type of the array being potentially unrelated to the runtime class of the other object  no matter how you do it. (the only exception would be if   were final  so it has no subclasses  but then your restriction would be meaningless because it would be trivially always true.)  
 what about next?         in this case the type of the second argument must extend (or be the same as) the type of the array's elements.   
 this is what i ended up doing.       
 you need to provide multiple parameterized types  and then do something if they don't match.

 change:         to:           is incrementing   (like  )  so by the time you get through the first iteration of the loop    is already 2.    additional: this is the first thing that leapt out at me  but i'm curious as to your definition of \"swap\". this little fix will just result in the first character being moved all the way to the end e.g. \"swap\" will become \"waps\".

 because   class doesn't have the method     change:             to:             or cast the object like:         
 for proper polymorphism  you should declare shape abstract and add a hello method to it.    then  in rectangle  create a hello method with the same arguments.    it'd look something like this:         then this would work         do note that all methods in java are  virtual .  this isn't true of all languages and in things like c# you might have to specify the virtual keyword (  may automatically imply    though)  
 because it is a   object  and shape does not have the   function. try making it a rectangle:       
      that line alone means that execute the implementations of rectangle class of shape class methods. since shape doesn't have a method hellorectangle  you cannot access it.  
 you cannot do that because you used polymorphic assignment and static type of your objects is  . even though the dynamic type is   and the object has the method on itself you cannot call it without a cast:         that happens because the compiler doesn't know the dynamic type of the object and hence is not aware that the method exists there.    read more about static/dynamic polymorphism:     http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/neutral-137988.html      http://beginnersbook.com/2013/04/runtime-compile-time-polymorphism/   
 if you want to do an http     from a java client to a servlet  the following requirement  must  be met:      the   header  must  be    . this is usually the default. if you want to send file data or any relevant data stream set your   to  . this requires the information sent to conform to  rfc2388 .   values sent from the connection   to the servlet must be an encoded ( ) key/value pair (separated by a  ).   the   header  must  be the length of the encoded value mentioned in 2 or the length of all data that you're willing to send to the server/servlet.      on the servlet side  you can use   method (passing the parameter key) to obtain its value. for    you can then use  .    i hope this helps. a brilliant example  written by balusc on stackoverflow  on how to fire http post in java can be found  here .

 you need to correct the signature of your method and add the placeholders inside the   annotation to map the path parts to those  -annotated arguments. the parts that are query params should use the   annotation.         also  be aware that if you web application is rooted at some context path (this is typical for applications deployed inside servlet containers like tomcat or jboss)  the context path will be part of the url  e.g.       
 this is the address         and you are calling         where you are treating word \"origin\" (and the rest) as parameter  while its actually part of address  i believe you have no rest service attached to:         thats why you are getting 404.    those words you are trying to pull are of type @pathparam  @queryparam is what you have after   sign  
 i'm not sure if you've forgotten to add it but your   misses setting the searchable info on the  :         as a side note:    i've had problems with the   meta-tag  when using flavors. it seemed to only work when using the full path (skipping the flavor) to the search activity e.g.:       
 put these lines in   method :         and make    static  like this :       
 move the method calls inside your main method         also  if you don't want an instance of the class   when calling   you must make the method static  chage to this:           and one last nitpick  respect the java naming conventions and rename your method to start with lowercase. variables and methods always start with a lowercase letter and classes name start with an uppercase one.  
 you are calling   function in class boundary(outside any methods and blocks) which is not possible. in class boundary only  declaration  and  instantiation  can be done.   put    inside main or any other method.         and change the   method to  .   edit-  class boundary &lt;- outside any methods and blocks  
 what is executed is the   method of your class  so  putting the calls to   outside it does not make the desired effect. you need to put the call to your method inside the main method. also  the saymyname has to be static in order for it to be called from the main. you might want to see  this  (about static methods in java) just like this:       
 call the methods from   by moving the following in  :         so that your program looks like this:         if you want to call your methods directly without making an instance of the class then you need the   keyword in the declaration of the method. this is what i have done in the above program.  
 go to java settings in control panel -> java -> security tab and make sure that enable java content in browser is on and your security level is not too high - that was a problem when i was testing the applet.    in addition to this as far as i know in java 8 security settings requires applet to be signed.  so no more unsigned and self signed  i am still on 7 + last time i had to do with applets was about a year ago.

 your first one (non-critical) is a little trickier  but to make sure all terms in the query are found in all results  you can simply make all of the query terms required.  you can do this with either added plus operators:            (if you want to handle prefixes  you'll need to add the wildcards to specify it  or possibly use an ngram tokenizer  or some such)   etc.      or  you can just set the default operator to be    using                in the case of   vs    phrase slop will probably  i think  get you where you need to be.  swapping the order of terms will add two to the distance  so:       : matches \"foo-bar-herp\"    : does not      phrase queries do not support wildcards though  so if you need to combine this with prefix terms  you'll run into problems.    if you want to allow more slop than that without the order being changed  then i believe you are moving outside the ability of the   to express your query  and will need to go to the   api to construct your queries manually.    constructing queries manually  you could do something like:         which looks for the the first term (exact match) and a prefix of the second term  in order  with no more than five terms between them.

 take a look at  this post in particular .  i've experienced similar issues with   and with java's   class and for the longest time  i could not find this link as proof that other people have experienced the same thing... until now.  similarly  someone experienced related issues  in this post  but it isn't quite the same at what you're experiencing.    essentially  the reason why images loaded in both java and matlab are different is due to enhancement purposes.  matlab scales the intensities so the image isn't mostly black.  essentially  the maximum intensity in your pgm gets scaled to   while the other intensities are linearly scaled to suit the dynamic range of  .  so for example  if your image had a dynamic range from   in your pgm file  before  loading it in with    this would get scaled to   and not be the original scale of  .  as such  you would have to know the maximum intensity value of the image before you loaded it in (by scanning through the file yourself).  that is very easily done by reading the third line of the file.  in your case  this would be  .  once you find this  you would need to scale every value in your image so that it is rescaled to what it originally was before you read it in.      to confirm that this is the case  take a look at the first pixel in your image  which has intensity 21 in the original pgm file.  matlab would thus scale the intensities such that:           would be the input intensity and   is the output intensity.  as such  if    then   would be:         this matches up with the first pixel when reading it out in matlab.  similarly  the sixth pixel in the first row  the original value is 18.  matlab would scale it such that:         this again matches up with what you see in matlab.  starting to see the pattern now?  basically  to undo the scaling  you would need to multiply by the reciprocal of the scaling factor.  as such  given that   is the image you loaded in  you need to do:           is the output image and   is the maximum intensity found in your pgm file  before  you loaded it in with  .  this  undoes  the scaling  as matlab scales the images from  .  note that i need to cast the image to   first  do the multiplication with the scaling factor as this will most likely produce floating point values  then  re-cast  back to  .  therefore  to bring it back to    you would have to scale in the  opposite  way.     specifically in your case  you would need to do:         the disadvantage here is that you need to know what the maximum value is prior to working with your image  which can get annoying.  one possibility is to use matlab and actually open up the file with file pointers and get the value of the third line yourself.  this is also an annoying step  but i have an alternative for you.    alternative... probably better for you    alternatively  here are two links to functions written in matlab that read and write pgm files  without  doing that unnecessary scaling  and it'll provide the results that you are expecting (unscaled).       reading:  http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/m_src/pgma_io/pgma_read.m .     writing:  http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/m_src/pgma_io/pgma_write.m       how the read function works is that it opens up the image using file pointers and manually parses in the data and stores the values into a matrix.  you probably want to use this function instead of relying on  .  to save the images  file pointers are again used and the values are written such that the pgm standard is maintained and again  your intensities are unscaled.  
 your java implementation is printing the ascii values of the text bytes \"21 2 1\" etc.          some pgm files use a text header  but binary representation for the pixels themselves. these are marked with a different magic string at the beginning. it looks like the java code is reading the file as if it had binary pixels.    instead  your pgm file has ascii-coded pixels  where you want to scan a whitespace-separated value for each pixel.  you do this the same way you read the width and height.    the debug code might look like this:       
 turns out that the signature of the method was incorrect. the right one is:         is a little confusing because in the official samples they have this:         as you can see there is only one by there  the usual one.  
 there's no such  configuration  for eclipse; it goes against the fundamental concept that the ide supports arbitrary numbers of projects and debug processes. the only options you have involve custom code  either in your application (as suggested by @gábor bakos in the comments above) or via a plug-in you write yourself.  
 to be able to use   in such a way  the whole file must fit into the buffer of the  .    that means you must either create a   with a buffer that is large enough or create a new instance when you want to read the file again.  
 try this:       
 the documentation of bufferedreader for  mark method  calls the parameter   and states that        an attempt to reset the stream after reading characters up to this limit or beyond may fail.      so it seems that mark only works forward and doesn't works for reset to the start.    also take a look at this  question .  
 the text book you are folliowing is 16 years out of date. skeletons haven't been generated automatically since 1998. you don't need one.  
 if you can  update to 1.4.2. it fixes some known resilience issues  including cascading failures like you describe.    regardless of that  the default configuration will definitely get you in trouble. minimum  you may need to look at setting up circuitbreakers for e.g. field data caches.    here's a snippet lifted from our production configuration. i assume you have also configured linux filehandles limits correctly:  see here        
 with the given details it is hard to understand what could be the root cause of the issue. i would suggest two things       proxy your datasource and see the query execution time from java end. you can do this by using the  datasource-proxy  library.     trace  oracle   sessions  and  understand  if there is something wrong at the oracle side.     
 caching exists for queries both within hibernate and within oracle  but it only works properly when using prepared statements with parameters  otherwise it can hurt instead.    try changing the string concatenation in your code to a parameterized query:       
 you can extend   to handle the decryption logic. you need to add the logic to decode password and return it from   method e.g.          after that in your spring configuration file use this class as datasource       
 the class you use here ( ) can't be changed.    i suggest you either :       override this class  and override the setpassword method in order to decrypt the password value.     use a custom property placeholder that does encryption (something like  this )     
 first you need to get an index of the element you want to change/replace.         searching into the list has a complexity o(n). until your array is not sorted and you can calculate an index from the value you can keep this solution.  
 first of all copy the jar in  is not a good solution since then you've to copy this jar in all the client machines which will use your applet.    i think that the problem with your code is in your   definition  you're using   to define    however in documentation   and others are defined as attributes of   tag  take a look at  documentation . so try defining the   as follows:         note that it's better to use   since   tag will not be supported in    also think about  use    which can make more easy to deploy an applet in a different browsers.     hope this helps   
 you have this:         change it to:       
   have you check that mainpage.jsp is present in web-inf/pages/ folder.   change public class appconfig extends webmvcconfigureradapter      change bean as :         may this will help you  
 getting rid of your custom view resolver and setting the application properties was the right start. the whole point of spring boot is that it does a pretty good job of wiring these things up for you! :)    you should have a controller with the request mappings. something like:         ... which would use your   template for any requests to  .    however  it's worth noting that by default  the contents of   don't get built into the executable application jar. to deal with his there are a couple of options i know of.     option 1  - move everything from   to  . i  think  this works for jsps too. the only trouble here is that you can hot-replace code unless you're running the application in an ide.     option 2  - the alternative (which i tend to use) is to set up my maven build to copy the contents of   into the classpath   folder when i build.         for further reading (although this looks quite a bit like what you're already doing)  there's a sample project  showing a spring boot app using jsp for templating:     https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-samples/spring-boot-sample-web-jsp/   
 you need the  eclipse gradle tooling   which adds lots of gradle-related functionality. most importantly  it manages your eclipse project build path to match the   dependencies.  
 in my original answer  i argued against the legality of the suggested optimization. i backed this mainly from information of the  jsr-133 cookbook  where it states that a  volatile read  must not be reordered with another  volatile read  and where it further states that a cached read is to be treated as a reordering. the latter statement is however formulated with some ambiguouity which is why i went through the  formal definition of the jmm  where i did not find such indication. therefore  i would now argue that the optimization is allowed. however  the jmm is quite complex and the discussion on this page indicates that this corner case might be decided differently by someone with a more thorough understanding of the formalism.    denoting  thread 1  to execute         and  thread 2  to execute:         the two reads   and two writes   of   are  synchronization actions  as   is   (jsr 17.4.2). they are  external actions  as variable   is used in several threads. these actions are contained in the set of all actions  . there exists a total order of all synchronization actions  the  synchronization order  which is consistent with  program order  for  thread 1  and  thread 2  (jsr 17.4.4). from the definition of the  synchronizes-with  partial order  there is no edge defined for this order in the above code. as a consequence  the  happens-before order  only reflects the  intra-thread semantics  of each thread (jsr 17.4.5).    with this  we define   as a  write-seen function  where   and a  value-written function    (jls 17.4.6). i took some freedom and eliminated   as it makes this outline of a formal proof even simpler. the question is of this proposed execution   is  well-formed  (jls 17.5.7). the proposed execution   obeys intra-thread semantics  is happens-before consistent  obeys the synchronized-with order and each read observes a consistent write. checking the causality requirements is trivial (jsr 17.4.8). i do neither see why the rules for  non-terminating executions  would be relevant as the loop covers the entire discussed code (jls 17.4.9) and we do not need to distinguish  observable actions .    for all this  i cannot find any indication of why this optimization would be forbidden. nevertheless  it is not applied for   reads by the hotspot vm as one can observe using  . i assume that the performance benefits are however minor and this pattern is not normally observed.  
 short answer:    yes  this optimization is allowed. collapsing two sequential read operations produes the observable behavior of the sequence being  atomic   but does not appear as a  reordering  of operations. any sequence of actions performed on a single thread thread of execution can be executed as an atomic unit. in general  it is difficult to ensure a sequence of operations executes atomically  and it rarely results in a performance gain because most execution environments  introduce overhead  to execute items atomically.    in the example given by the original question  the sequence of operations in question is the following:         performing these operations atomically guarantees that the value read on the first line is equal to the value read on the second line. furthermore  it means the value read on the second line is the value contained in   at the time the first read was executed (and vice versa  because atomic both read operations occurred at the same time according to the observable execution state of the program). the optimization in question  which is reusing the value of the first read for the second read  is equivalent to the compiler and/or jit executing the sequence atomically  and is thus valid.       original longer answer:    the java memory model describes operations using a  happens-before  partial ordering. in order to express the restriction that the first read   and second read   of   cannot be collapsed  you need to show that some operation is semantically required to appear between them.    the operations on the thread with   and   is the following:         to express the requirement that something (say  ) lie between   and    you need to require that    happens-before     and     happens-before   . as it happens  there is no rule where a read operation appears on the left side of a  happens-before  relationship. the closest you could get is saying    happens-before     but the partial order would allow   to also occur before    thus collapsing the read operations.    if no scenario exists which  requires  an operation to fall between   and    then you can declare that  no operation ever  appears between   and   and not violate the required semantics of the language. using a single read operation would be equivalent to this claim.     edit  my answer is getting voted down  so i'm going to go into additional details.    here are some related questions:        is the java compiler or jvm  required  to collapse these read operations?     no. the expressions   and   used in the add expression are not constant expressions  so there is no requirement that they be collapsed.       does  the jvm collapse these read operations?     to this  i'm not sure of the answer. by compiling a program and using    it's easy to see that the java compiler does not collapse these read operations. unfortunately it's not as easy to prove the jvm does not collapse the operations (or even tougher  the processor itself).       should  the jvm collapse these read operations?     probably not. each optimization takes time to execute  so there is a balance between the time it takes to analyze the code and the benefit you expect to gain. some optimizations  such as array bounds check elimination or checking for null references  have proven to have  extensive  benefits for real-world applications. the only case where this particular optimization has the possibility of improving performance is cases where two identical read operations appear sequentially.    furthermore  as shown by the response to this answer along with the other answers  this particular change would result in an  unexpected  behavior change for certain applications which users may not desire.        edit 2:  regarding rafael's description of a claim that two read operations that cannot be reordered. this statement is designed to highlight the fact that caching the read operation of   in the following sequence could produce an incorrect result:         suppose initially   and   have their default value 0. then you execute just the first  .    now suppose another thread executes the following sequence:         finally  suppose the first thread executes the line  . if you were to cache the originally read value of    you would end up with the following call:         this is not correct. since the updated value of   was stored before writing to    there is no way to read the value    and then  read the value  . without caching  the correct sequence of events leads to the following call.         however  if you were to ask the question \"is there any way to allow the read of   to be cached?\"  the answer is yes. if you can execute  all three  read operations in the first thread sequence as an  atomic unit   then caching the value is allowed. while synchronizing across multiple variables is difficult and rarely provides an opportunistic optimization advantage  it is certainly conceivable to encounter an exception. for example  suppose   and   are each 4 bytes  and they appear sequentially in memory with   aligned on an 8-byte boundary. a 64-bit process could implement the sequence   as an atomic 64-bit load operation  which would allow the value of   to be cached (effectively treating all three read operations as an atomic operation instead of just the first two).  
     on one hand the very purpose of a volatile read is that it should always be fresh from memory.      that is not how the java language specification defines volatile. the jls simply says:        a write to a volatile variable   (§8.3.1.4)  synchronizes-with  all subsequent reads of   by any thread (where \"subsequent\" is defined according to the synchronization order).       therefore  a write to a volatile variable  happens-before  (and is visible to) any subsequent reads of that same variable.     this constraint is trivially satisfied for a read that is not subsequent. that is  volatile only ensures visibility of a write if the read is known to occur after the write.     this is not the case in your program. for every well formed execution that observes a to be 1  i can construct another well formed execution where a is observed to be 0  simply be moving the read after the write. this is possible because the happens-before relation looks as follows:         that is  all the jmm guarantees for your program is that a+a will yield 0  1 or 2. that is satisfied if a+a always yields 0. just as the operating system is permitted to execute this program on a single core  and always interrupt thread 1 before the same instruction of the loop  the jvm is permitted to reuse the value - after all  the observable behavior remains the same.    in general  moving the read across the write violates happens-before consistency  because some other synchronization action is \"in the way\". in the absence of such intermediary synchronization actions  a volatile read can be satisfied from a cache.  
 modified the op problem a little          if the above code have been executed sequentially  then there exist a valid sequential consistent execution which will break the  thread2 while loop .    whereas if  compiler   optimizes a+a to 2a then  thread2 while loop  will never exist .    so the above optimization will prohibit one particular execution if it had been sequentially executed code.     main question   is this optimization a problem ?           ans.   a program is correctly synchronized if  when it is executed in a sequentially consistent manner  there are no data races. refer example 17.4.8-1 from jls chapter 17         sequential consistency is a strong guarantee. the execution path where compiler optimizes a+a   as 2a is also a  valid sequentially consistent execution .     so the answer is yes.          ans.   sequential consistency implies  that happens before guarantee is valid here .          so the answer is yes.  jls ref       so i don't think optimization is invalid legally  at least in the op case.    the case where the  thread 2 while loops stucks into an infinte is also quite possible without compiler transformation.   
     would it be illegal for a jit compiler to emit assembly corresponding to 2*a instead of a+a?      it would be illegal unless the jvm can guarantee that no write can happen between the two reads  for example because it applies some sort of sequential execution model.    the jmm reasons in terms of writes and reads and your program contains two writes and two reads:         so your println   must   print:      0 if r1 and r2 happen between w2 and w1   2 if r1 and r2 happen between w1 and w2   1 if r1 happens between w1 and w2 (resp. w2 and w1) and r2 happens between w2 and w1 (resp. w2 and w1)      the relevant jls bit is (among others)  #17.4.5 :        a write to a volatile field (§8.3.1.4) happens-before every subsequent read of that field.      which  essentially  means: if from a wall clock perspective a read r is subsequent to a write w then r will read whatever w has written.    to summarise:  a compliant jvm must either read the variable twice or  if it emits a   instruction  it must prevent any writes from happening concurrently.     typical modern jvms designed to run on multithreaded architecture would apply the former.  
 as laid out in other answers there are two reads and two writes. imagine the following execution (t1 and t2 denote two threads)  using annotations that match the jls statement below:      t1:     t2:     t1:     t2:     t2:        in a concurrrent environment this is definitely a possible thread interleaving. your question is then: would the jvm be allowed to make   observe   and read 0 instead of 1?     jls #17.4.5  states:        a set of actions a is happens-before consistent if for all reads r in a  where w(r) is the write action seen by r  it is not the case that either hb(r  w(r)) or that there exists a write w in a such that w.v = r.v and hb(w(r)  w) and hb(w  r).      the optimisation you propose ( ) would violate that requirement. so your optimisation can only work if there is no intervening write between   and    which can't be guaranteed in a typical multi threaded framework.    as a side comment  note however that there is no guarantee as to how long it will take for the writes to become visible from the reading thread. see for example:  detailed semantics of volatile regarding timeliness of visibility .  
 typically with any kind of physics you want to store the speed of an object as well as its position.  that way  each time though your update loop you just have to change the y position by the y speed.  when the collision occurs  all you need to do is calculate the new   and update  .

 problem was solved path to the data directory was wrong in windows service file.    so i delete the service file from this method:      1)run regedit or regedt32.        2)go to the registry entry \"hkey_local_machine/system/currentcontrolset/services\"        3)look for the postgresql service that you want delete and delete it.        4)reboot the computer.      after that open the cmd (run as administrator) go to the postgresql bin directory and run this command to create a new windows service:         this worked fro me. hope this will help.

 if you don't use aop features that require runtime proxying for e.g. transaction management - @transactional  nothing should be proxied. go through  this link  for more details.    this can also be verified through debugging.  
 you need to use callback pattern. very basic example (with java 8 notation but you could replace it by  )         and in           but it is in place solution. not very elastic...    for more elastic solution you could create   like that:         and now you could make any call async just injecting   and then:         but you should take care about \"two-way async\" and remove   from original method.  
 you cant use where clause in  insert  statement. if you wish to modify a row where hotel id is 16 then consider using  update  statement.    side note - your sql is vulnerable to  sql code injection   
 your problem is in line:         you can't use where in insert clause. just pass this as a parameter in values.          btw: passing variables by concatenation is bad practice and can provide to sql injection. use instead parametralized query like here:  http://www.mkyong.com/jdbc/jdbc-preparestatement-example-insert-a-record/    
 this happens when your app can't find an arcgis runtime deployment.    if you're running on a machine with the arcgis runtime sdk for java installed  set the value of environment variable   to the directory where arcgisruntime10.2.4 is located. the default value is    though the sdk installer should have set this environment variable for you.    if you're running on a machine without the arcgis runtime sdk for java installed   create a runtime deployment  and place it in the working directory for your app (  in your case). this is how you deploy arcgis runtime to end-user machines.    alternatively  you can set the directory containing the arcgis runtime deployment programmatically using      but i don't recommend it because then your app will require that the runtime deployment be located in the same directory on every machine.  
 the easiest way might be to use a  flood fill  algorithm to eliminate all the zeros that are  not  encircled by ones  and then checking whether there are any left.    first  put all the zeros directly on the \"fringe\" of the 2d array into a queue. then  use the flood fill algorithm to turn all of those into a different number (e.g.  2)  and add the nodes next to them to the fringe set (either diagonally or only direct neighbours). repeat until there are no more nodes in the fringe. finally  check whether there are any more zeros in the array. if so  those were not connected to the fringe region and thus had to be \"encircled\" by ones.         example output:         the complexity should be on the order of  o(nxm)   since each of the  nxm  nodes can only appear once in the queue (plus a bit of overhead for constructing the queue and finding remaining zeros).  
  please note that i have assumed that you need rectangle shape surrounding     you need to find sequences for 3 or more   in one row.          for each sequence check if there is sequence of the same length 2 or more rows lower.         for each \"pair\" of sequences check if they are connected with   on the edges.       
      is this what you wanted?  
 a more generic way could be -    
 retrieving common whatever using sql:         if you must do it in java i suggest populating two hashsets and          setrepresentingtablea will contain common whatevers.  
 one way of comparing across databases in an environment that doesn't support heterogeneous queries is to compare in batches.    suppose we start with a query          where   is one of the tables to compare.    the first comparing query is:          where the 1000 values v1 thru v1000 are taken from table-1.    the next query is:           how well this performs depends on factors like whether there is a suitable index including   on table-2. my expectation is that all things being equal it's faster to 'look' for the smaller table in the larger table just because it will require fewer batches.    obviously there is nothing special about chunks of 1000 and you might want to work out what the practical limit is for the length of sql string the server will accept! if you could cram 10000 values you'd be done on 90 queries!    one further uplift might then be to use a prepared statement rather than executing sql strings. remember to handle odd-end chunks by then running a special query or back-filling the slack variables.     ps:  one very significant benefit of this line of attack is that it doesn't place unbounded memory demands on the application server (wherever the java is running). the other methods such as hash-tables are valid but the storage demands they place on the app. server grow as the database tables grow.   
 the immediate answer to this is do not bring  all the data into java and compare. just bring the data matches to your criteria.     pass both values to a query and write a query in sql.  
 you are doing   queries to the data base. try downloading sets of rows from the tables and iterating over them. i suggest an example in  pseudocode :

 b cannot be cast to [ljava.lang.object;    means you are indeed getting bytearray and you are trying to convert it into object array.  
 this problem is caused because     returns a raw  . as a result  you are able to write code that causes a  . with a properly typed list  the compiler would prevent this.    as explained in the other answer  the text   means that a   is being cast to an    which is not allowed.    this means that your list contains   objects and you should declare it as such:         in addition  the contents of your for-loop now look incorrect:         since   is now a    it's not correct to cast a   to a  . perhaps you need to remove the array index  .  
 the event for scrolling the mouse wheel in javafx is called    .    you can either add an   to the node.         alternatively (using fxml)    inside of the fxml file where you add   to your pane:          (if you are using    this can be done in   section)     in the  controller   you can handle the   by using:

 you are seeing several things:      you are adding the numbers as strings to the value string.   you are writing an octal number ( )  because you start the literal number with a    which really means   in decimals.   trailing decimal zeroes are removed from literals. (  ->  )      so rewriting your code in several steps gives:                           
 you're imagining that addition is being done  but it's not.  these are strings.    first value is 0.4.    second value is 010  which means octal.  that translates to 8 in decimal.    third value is 0.6    you don't say what you expected to see.  if you really wanted addition to happen  i'd recommend enclosing in parentheses to make the addition happen.  you'll still have to decide if that octal value was intentional or a typo.  
 you use different filehandles. your output goes to      writes to   wich will flush on different times.  
 basically  you should use a local variable:         now you know for sure that your   variable will be assigned exactly once.    i would then use a conditional operator for    which makes it clearer that there's exactly one assignment:

 if you're website is slowing down when you increase the session timeout you are probably storing too much data in the session    you can use the seam debug page to see what objects are being stored in the session and try to move some down to a shorter-lived scope (page or request)  or if the data really needs to span multiple redirects then write it off to a persistent datastore and reduce the session timeout.    if on the other hand you have a very high number of concurrent sessions then you should probably look at clustering your server and using sticky sessions to spread the load across multiple jboss instances  
    the hibernate named queries are expressed in an object query language (jpql or hql)  so hibernate needs to translate them to sql first. the named queries are stored in a  namedqueryrepository  and each query is represented by a  namedquerydefinition .     because the user can dynamically add filters  query result limits  locks and hints  hibernate cannot pre-compile the hql/jpql until execution time.      hibernate also uses a  prepartedstatement  for each select and dml statements  so you also get database statement precompilation.     
    in the eclipse buildpath  make sure you have the maven dependency jars downloaded  under \"maven dependencies\" if you dont see  run the below command to download the same. mvn clean dependency:copy-dependencies package     this may sound silly  but in my experience i have seen this working. do a project clean in eclipse and do a maven build     
 there is no maven dependencies classfolder in your screenshot. have you tried right-clicking the project name -> maven -> update project?     update unbound classpath var.m2_repo     you need to fix your maven installation. go to window -> preferences -> maven and have a look at: installations and usersettings  
     it still doesn't show up until it reached it's stop.      your code is executing on the event dispatch thread (edt)  which is the thread that is responsible for handling gui events and repainting the gui. the thread.sleep() prevents the gui from repainting itself until the while/loop is finished executing so you only see the painting at the end. read the section from the swing tutorial on  concurrency  for more information.    the solution is to use a  swing timer  to provide the animation  not thread.sleep().   
 it looks like you don't actually have the   call anywhere in your code. i would have that in both the   and   commands.     another thing  you're using jpanels as your wagons. i wouldn't do this  it'll take more resources and is bad practice. unless there's a specific reason  i'd use a base sprite image  and load it to an   array  and paint that array to that screen using bufferedimage  instead of having x number of jpanel's running around.  
 if you don't have access to the class  you cannot modify it.    instead  find the code that instantiates it  and add a synchronized block around it:         now  in your thread code  do:         may i ask why you need this? if a field is made private  there is usually a reason for it. you are circumventing the class creator's intent with your use of reflection ...  also  initializing static fields in an instance constructor seems ... fishy :-/  
 what you read in the blog must have been about factory methods and similar techniques  which don't  avoid     but rather place it behind a more flexible api.    there are definetely no overarching downsides to the   operator. it has been  and will remain  the staple of any java code  and the most natural way to actually create an object  as opposed to satisfying a more generic concern  such as \"provide me with an entry point to your api\".    all other techniques that create objects without involving   are special-purpose tools (cloning  deserialization  etc.).  
 when you use class.forname  the class name can be set at runtime. that can be useful for drivers e.g.    when you use new  instead  the class name of the instance you're creating is hard coded. in general  this creates high  coupling   and should be avoided (except when  you're absolutely sure you'll always need this coupling).    in short   if you want to create an instance of a specific class     makes no harm.     however  you should ask yourself:      if you really need a new instance (otherwise  you should replace   by a  singleton  or a pool).   if you'll always use the same class for that instance (otherwise  you should replace   by  dependency injection  or the  factory pattern ).    
  complex objects     in general you may consider avoiding   for reasonably complex objects with non-trivial creation. you can consider some factory/builder which add versatility.    for example if you create a big composite object it is good to use builder pattern.  ( long example here )     simple objects     for simple objects (most common case) it is best to stick with  .    for example if you have simple class         then it is an overkill to create factory for this and you should call it by       dependency injection     in enterprise applications you commonly use dependency injection  which let's you avoid using   explicitly. you won't remove all object instantiations  but it provides nice improvement.  ( basic spring tutorial here )  
 there is no replacement for    even    has  to work exactly like    the only difference being that you're hardcoding the full class (or even  ) hence actually achieve the  opposite  of what you're trying to do  with   the instance may be dynamically resolved and/or even injected.    if you inject an instance of   you may very well get a bean of class   which implements   - thats in fact more dynamic and complements factory patterns very well. thats hardly possible if your classname is hardcoded  at least in my humble opinion.  
 if you like sluggish  slow code  that is hard to debug  maintain and understand  absolutely  avoid using   keyword at all costs  obfuscate as much as possible!  
     but in case if i make private a a; volatile can i be sure that each thread will access only completely constructed object?      yes.    consider the case where thread #1 initializes  .  the factory mutex ensures that only one thread at a time may create an  .  so we have the following sequence:       thread #1 sees   is null     thread #1 acquires the mutex.     thread #1 see   is still null.     thread #1 constructs an   instance  which initializes its variables.     thread #1 assigns the instance reference to  .     thread #1 releases the lock.       for a thread #2 to see   in the non-null state (e.g. at either the step #1 or step #3 test)  that means that thread #1 must have gotten to (at least) step #5.  but that means         \"happens-before\"         \"happens before\"          \"happens before\"         \"happens before\"         since there is a complete chain of \"happens before\" relations from the initialization of the fields of the new   in thread #1 to the field access in thread #2.  that means that thread #2 is  guaranteed  to see results of the field initialization writes ... unless there are  other  intervening writes to those fields.    note that it is the \"happens before\" between the write to the volatile   and the subsequent read in the other thread that is the key.  if   is not volatile  then there isn't a complete \"happens before\" chain and  therefore  the execution is not \"happens-before consistent\"; i.e. it contains a \"data race\".    the terminology and reasoning that i have used / followed above comes from the java language specification   chapter 17.4 .  
  volatile     the java volatile keyword is used to mark a java variable as \"being stored in main memory\". more precisely that means  that every read of a volatile variable will be read from the computer's main memory  and not from the cpu cache  and that every write to a volatile variable will be written to main memory  and not just to the cpu cache.     its related to memory. it wont affect constructor.     source : click  here   
 since you want a to be a singleton my suggestion would be to make a an enum.   using enum :      will solve your issue as you wont ever have a partially constructed enum    and also using enum is the best way to implement the singleton pattern.          
 there are two different things specification and implementation. if you make   volatile  that will solve the problem in practice  because jvm will insert a store barrier after assignment. but this will still break a specification  because   is not like    it does not guarantee  that all subobjects of an object will be published. btw  on cpus with strong memory model a lot of bad code will work fine  but this does not mean you should write so.  
 as you rightly analyzed hibernate wraps the original databse excption as cause.    the question though is if it makes sense to catch such an exception. i don't know your business domain  but generally packettoobigexception means you are trying to store a file which is too big as blob.     such issues are better dealt with at validation time. either you increase the maximum allowed size by          and validate while uploading the file.     update:     according to mysql documentation it is safe to increase the limit for all queries (by changing the variable or editing my.ini).      http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/packet-too-large.html     quoting from above link:        it is safe to increase the value of this variable because the extra   memory is allocated only when needed. for example  mysqld allocates   more memory only when you issue a long query or when mysqld must   return a large result row. the small default value of the variable is   a precaution to catch incorrect packets between the client and server   and also to ensure that you do not run out of memory by using large   packets accidentally.      but even after increasing it to a new max  you always run a risk of uploading a bigger file  so it is always better to have a validation check on user interface itself.  
 when you implement an interface method  you are allowed to declare that you throw  fewer  exceptions than listed in the interface.     when you call    you are invoking   on an   instance. the compiler knows this doesn't throw anything  so you are fine.    had you done:          then you would need to catch the exception declared in the interface  because the compiler only knows it's dealing with a   instance.  
 according to jls  requirements in overriding and hiding :        b is a class or interface  and a is a superclass or superinterface of b  and a method declaration m2 in b overrides or hides a method declaration m1 in a. then:        for every checked exception type listed in the throws clause of m2    that same exception class or one of its supertypes must occur in the   erasure (§4.6) of the throws clause of m1; otherwise  a compile-time   error occurs.      means that extending method can have only a stronger exception policy. if it has a weaker restrictions  than such method can't be used instead of a base method and it breaks concept of overriding.

 you need to make sure that all your fields in your class are   as  this tutorial  suggests.  of particular note are the requirements for a class to be  :        notice that for a class to be serialized successfully  two conditions must be met:        the class must implement the java.io.serializable interface.        all of the fields in the class must be serializable. if a field is not serializable  it must be marked transient.      this means you'll have to do some digging in the javadocs for all the fields in your   class.  for instance  i did a quick search on    and there seems to be a bit of a  nuance  when it comes to  saving a  .  when you retrieve the state of your saved game  it might be better just to recreate the gui from scratch rather than to rely upon   to do it for you.   this thread  also seems to concur that it's not a good idea to rely on java to restore a gui for you  but gives a suggestion as to how to possibly make it work:        once deserialised  you will need to show the frame with

 you cannot get the uid of something after it has been deleted. deleting is deleting.    the classic way to solve this is to use the uid as cache key and design your program so you can cache deleted messages for a while without ill effect. for instance  if you want to display unseen mail  ask the server what's unseen right now  then ask your cache for those messages.  
 if you prefetch the uids for all messages (using the folder.fetch method) you should be able to get the uid of a message using the folder.getuid(message) after it's been deleted/expunged.  
  here is imapfolder source code.  you can see what is happening in getuid method.    api doc  says  :         i think you should cache messages uid while deletion in your messagecounterlistener may be  after when you need   you will be able to chech and get uid.

 this strange behavior could also be related to a different maven version on your jenkins build machine than you use locally. it would also be of interest which version of the   you are using in your  .     the pure   itself (bundled with the maven plugin of your project) uses a bunch of dependencies which might be in conflict with the cobertura integration of the jenkins environment. try to check for   in your dependency tree. maybe this causes runtime trouble in the jenkins environment as well.    a setup that works in my institution (with projects that include   dependencies):      latest jenkins version   in combination with the jenkins cobertura-plugin     latest   maven plugin for various projects in version        my strong guess: it is not about the   stuff itself  but about the environment of your setup; your jenkins version   is a bit outdated. i would advice you to go for an upgrade if possible with your admins/other projects.  
 your main issue is that your   may be   without you to know it. this can be caused by 2 reasons:       the  user cancelled the request   so   returns  . this is the message you actually get  but the source of your error can be different ;     the error could come from the  extension  parameter of   that is  ...  . if  an exception is raised   it would be nice to know about it  so i advise you add a message to the log (see code below).        solution:  you should log the   to keep track of the exception  and you should respect the   method prototype (to avoid any ambiguity) as described here:  filesaveservice interface .    this is the part of your code where are applied the previous advices:         if this doesn't solve your problem  this will at least give your more information about where it comes from.  
 in general you should use   or  .                 if you are using maven there is another option. you can access environment variables from maven by using  .  
 found a great utility class  https://gist.github.com/roydekleijn/5073579          thanks roy  
 it is not a problem of java  or libgdx. there are two possible causes:      your touchscreen digitizer has low refresh rate so that it just can't keep up with your finger's speed.   your main loop has a performance issue and something inside loop takes such a long time that you can't get enough number of touch  events.      either way  the result will be the same.  
 maybe an exception during static initialization of class testb.   first time. when java loads a class  the static initializers are performed. if you have a exception in this  java will not try again to load the class definition  instead a noclassdeffounderror is thrown. so maybe there is an oversight exception before the first noclassdeffounderror  
 this usually happens if either at runtime the class is not found:  - make sure your classpath contains the jar. or two classes with the same name exists on the classpath  in this case the jvm does not know which class to load.      check your classpath and make sure it is the same as your classpath during compile time.    
 this hql would work  .     however  this would return a   where each list element represents one row with 3 columns. you could extract these manually  or for example have some   object with constructor  . in that case  this         would return instances of  .  
 change the location of the   result to   result and location to  . after the post it will forward to the previous page.       
 it is possible to run selenium-server-standalone multiple times with different parameters. however seeing as you are experiencing unexpected behavior it can be concluded that such usage is not supported  as there is also no documentation to be found. to find the root cause of your problem more debugging needs to be done.    the selenium-standalone-server comes bundled with the grid server. the grid server has been designed (for exactly what you want) to execute and manage multiple tests. this allows you to execute multiple tests parallel  manage your browser configurations and keep track of the test results.    on  http://docs.seleniumhq.org  there is a guide on how to setup the grid server.    it is unknown  and highly unlikely  that it is possible to run a selenium ide html suite   directly with the grid server. there is no documentation to be found on this. however  it is possible to export an existing selenium ide html suite to webdriver compatible code.    of course you can always opted for running the tests in multiple virtual machines  this route also solves the problem from not being able to run multiple instances.  
 enums are compared as objects. these are two distinct objects of different classes. why should they be equal? a b c - are just names of variables. they mean nothing in comparison operation.  
 in order to understand why the output is false you should think of   as a class and   as  instances  of that class.    for example the comparison of the enums is like doing the following:

 by populating arraylist with index  you are overwriting the existing elements and hence you will just left with last elements in the xml if there are multiple tags. instead you should do something like:         and then you could do something like:         if you think it's just going to be once  then you could do something like:         it will print layer name followed by url followed by layer type followed by field.

 rather than rely on java code to do this  it's better if you just bundle a windows installer (msi) with your app.    you can use the   wix tool set  to do this.  use wix to create an minimal ui-less installer (msi file) that just installs the fonts with the  registerfonts  directive.  or a full installer that installs the app as well.    if your java application has any sort of installer script  you can have it invoke your msi file (runtime.exec). otherwise  bundle the msi as a resource like you are bundling the fonts. on the the first time your app runs or when it detects the fonts are missing  have it exec the msi file.    ideally  you have wix build a full installer that installs both the fonts and java code together and you distribute the msi (or setup.exe) for them to launch.

 your scenario works just fine in javase 1.7. what version of java are you using?       
 may be this example will help you  http://www.mkyong.com/hibernate/hibernate-one-to-many-relationship-example-annotation/   http://viralpatel.net/blogs/hibernate-one-to-many-annotation-tutorial/  can you please remove cascade=cascadetype.persist and try.    can you please write output of you query so i can help you.  
 i tried the code that you post. i see the insert queries being executed on the role and policy tables but the value in roleid column of the policy table is null. this is because you have set the role object in the policy instance. you have to set both ends of a relationship.     the below code should update the foreign key value       
 below is the fix        
 you can can use the  akka  library to wrap the problematic code - this will let you kill and restart the code if it hangs.                 in other words  the controller calls   on the problem code that has been wrapped in an actor; if this times out (5000 milliseconds in my example) you stop and restart the actor and loop through the controller method again.      will only execute one method at a time (it will enqueue subsequent invocations)  so if you want to concurrently execute   you'll need to create multiple actors and create a router out of them / place them in a queue / etc.  
 i would try   as even though the interrupted exception isn't thrown it doesn't necessarily mean that the 3rd party library doesn't handle it correctly in some other way. if that doesn't work then i would consider   even though it is depricated in the hopes that the library's design can handle sudden termination and doesn't end up in an inconsistent state (due to the transactional nature in which you are using it  i doubt there are many shared objects to get corrupted).   will cause the event to stop immediately and throw a   exception no matter what it is doing and it was deprecated by sun due to the chance of leaving shared objects in an unknown and inconsistent state.  
 once you get your array  you can iterate through all the elements of it.         which will output         if you only want the values in the nested array  you can do:         which will output       
 this may help:         will generate:    t:java.lang.string    foo    t:java.util.arraylist    foot mercato    football    foot center    foorzik    footao  
 you can replace   with a    it will easiar.       
 you should use a map:       
    
 here          you should check if   is not a value already in the array. so use         just after that and use         when printing the results.  
 ok  i've finally resolved it. there were two things about it.    at first: my tomcat server was not updating deployed files properly.     and finally i'm not pretty sure if it helped  but we added one more slash after file: specification  so that the result was:         now it is loading all config files properly.  
 this is just an idea but it may work     have you checked that the   file has the correct access rights? i mean  is it accessible by the user that runs your spring application?    it would help a lot if you show the error displayed.  
 one possiblity is the server version. that would explain why it works in some installations and not another. runwithdocumentcontext() was only added in 8.5.2  http://blog.nashcom.de/nashcomblog.nsf/dx/passing-a-document-to-an-agent-without-saving-it-first.htm   
 since your agent is java anyway  you can save the trouble of spinning up a new class loader and jvm environment. move the code into a jar and call it directly from the xpage.  i can't think of a good reason to use the agent (because it was there isn't a good reason in this case)  
 the idiom used in your qfixed get and put methods of   is broken  you should be using a while loop instead. see  the oracle tutorial on guarded blocks .    once i changed the names of the classes to remove 'fixed'  and replaced   with   in the q class  like this:         i got output starting with         where each value gets put and gotten once  which is the output you want.    there are several reasons why using the while loop is a good thing.    a waiting thread gives up the monitor  once it wakes up it has to reacquire the monitor before it can proceed with exiting the wait method. that means that other threads can take the monitor and possibly change the state of the data that the synchronization is protecting. once the thread has reacquired the monitor it needs to check the condition again before it can know whether the condition that it thinks it got notified for actually happened. otherwise the thread is deciding what to do based on stale information.    in examples involving three or more contending threads this would be a big issue. however  for this specific case i don't see an ordering of operations that is problematic.    another reason for the while loop is that just because a thread exits from waiting doesn't necessarily mean a notification took place. according to the  javadoc for object#wait :        a thread can also wake up without being notified  interrupted  or timing out  a so-called spurious wakeup. while this will rarely occur in practice  applications must guard against it by testing for the condition that should have caused the thread to be awakened  and continuing to wait if the condition is not satisfied. in other words  waits should always occur in loops  like this one:           this comes from a race condition in the jvm implementation; like the documentation says  it should be a rare occurrence. but it could be the source of the problem here  having the wait return without having been notified could produce a situation with multiple gets like what you saw.  
 i've just started working with the tsc barcode printers and have had great luck accessing them over the network. supposing your printer supports networking  the following snippet should get you headed in the right direction.       
 using   ensures that the  references  being passed are not reassigned. you can modify the object to which the reference points. thus  your object is not  immutable   it is still mutable but the reference cannot be reassigned.  
   means you can't change the value of that variable once it was assigned    the use of   for the arguments in those methods means it won't allow the programmer to change their value during the execution of the method.  
   on parameter will prevent code inside method to rewrite it.     rewriting parameter values is bad practice since it's very difficult to maintain such code.  
 if you use an array  you have to keep track of the number of elements stored inside and resize the array when necessary. the easiest way would be to keep the history as strings in  arraylist . you would add one message to that list per transaction:       
 you need a  queue  to do that. however  for a  simple  fast and primitive implementation  you can:      define an object called  ( )   add a   of  s into   class as an  attribute . i strongly recommend  renaming the class name  to   to make it seen as object.   at each operation add a new   to end of the   you just added.   at exit  print out the last -say- 10 elements of the  ; you can reach it through   object. you can also define a function in   class to print out the last 10 elements  if you make the function work according to selected number of elements  you can add number of  s to the function's inputs.    
 you can use binding files to  somewhat  achieve that:      use   to disable generation for the whole namespace/schema   use   to map \"unwanted\" classes to some (existing)   class.    
 i will give you a small example  although you should have a good read at jdbc adn specifically at  resultset :       
 your mistake is server and client both sending/receiving messages background without printing anything. like when you send message from client  server received it and again write to the client and it become infinite loop.    following things are wrong:     server.java          should be the last statement of loop    and   should       client.java          it should be last in loop    
 you're reading lines but you aren't sending lines. you need to send a line terminator.  
    can you check that you don't have a previous instance of your app still running  or a database browsing tool opened and in the middle of a transaction? open a terminal to browse &amp; work on the same table  could be the root cause . you can also execute   on the mysql command line. these will normally show you the full sql for the query that is locking.     if this doesn't help  verify that the mysql services were restarted after updating the timeout.     use hibernate connection pool with max pool size as 10. here is an  example  on how to do it.     
 here i print all directories child of your parent dir:         you can pass another lambda to the foreach method for your own purpose.   also replace ${parent.dir} with your correct value as a string.   (the code above may throw ioexception).  
 assuming that the   and   parts are parameters  while the in-between part is fixed  a solution can look like this:         it stops the iteration once it encounters a non-directory path component. you will have to adapt this behavior if you want to enforce a specific policy regarding following symbolic links  
 as far as i know \"init\" methods are used to implement constructors in bytecode. so i think there is a wrong constructor call. there is no classwriter constructor which accepts boolean argument. please try to use latest asm jar.  
 so i have solved the issue. i noticed that in the log file of my glassfish server there was an error mentionning unability to find my reference to the handlerchain for my webservices. after googling this  i found this was a bug reported in the 3.1.2.2 version of glassfish. the solution hence is just to upgrade the server. i run currently glassfish 4.1 with the respective jre7 of course and my application is deployed successfully.  thanks everyone  i hope this solves someone else's problem one day!  
     do something i have not proposed yet?      my recommendation would be to re-think the entire approach. one should not be removing / adding protocol interceptors at runtime but rather should be making use of   instance to update request execution context and pass configuration to protocol interceptors      http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-core-4.4.x/tutorial/html/fundamentals.html#d5e306   http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.3.x/tutorial/html/fundamentals.html#d5e223        
     or is it really mandatory from java that we must need to add site url in exception site list to avoid such blocking error.      basically yes. end users can disable the securoty popup  but you can't do it through you application. if you look at the oracle documentation  \"avoiding security dialogs\" . it's clearly stated that the securoty popup is an expected behaviour :        the java runtime will automatically warn the user about possible security sensitive issues. if you are confident that applications you use are safe  then it is possible to bypass security dialogs to simplify user experience.   if a java applet/webstart application is signed  a certificate security warning dialog box will pop up and the user must click the run button to give all permissions to the code of application.      and if you read the options to avoid the popup you wil see that they all imply modifying something on the end users computer.    here are the options (quoted from   \"avoiding security dialogs\" ):       user accepts the certificate used to sign the application and selects the check box always trust content from this publisher. then next time permissions will be granted to this application automatically (until the certificate expires or is removed from the trusted key store).     the certificate can be manually imported into the jre trusted certificate store. to import the certificate using the java control panel  choose the security tab and select certificates > trusted certificates. to import a certificate into the certificate store from the command line  use the keytool utility (in the jre's bin folder).     grant allpermissions in the java policy file located at ${user.home}/.java.policy  or point to any java policy file which has allpermissions in the $(jre_home)/lib/security/java.security file. permissions can be granted to all applications or restricted to a particular url. see default policy implementation and policy file syntax for more details on .java.policy.     
 your application is considered to be self-signed because you've signed it with a certificate that's not intended for code signing. self-signed applications are blocked with this nasty-looking popup:         you can prevent this popup  if you sign using a code signing certificate that's signed by a trusted certificate authority. then the user will get a way nicer looking confirmation dialog that lists your name as the publisher of the application:         see also oracle's documentation on  security dialogs  for a description of the dialogs and why and when they appear.    take a look at the documentation on  working with signed rias   in particular 23.2 \"signing rias\"  for information on how to create a code signing certificate to sign your applet.    a second nice link is  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/java-code-signing-1915323.html#5     --update--     what exactly makes a certificate a code signing certificate?     x.509 certificates may include key usage fields (ku's) and  extended key usage fields  (eku's). these fields  when present   restrict  the valid usage of the certificate. the java plugin checks for the presence of these fields.    i've found the source code for the  endentitychecker  that performs this check.         the check methods look as follows:         note that if no ku or eku is specified  the ku or eku checker returns true. but if ku's are specified  the  digital signature  ku should be one of them. similarly  if any eku's are specified  either the eku  code signing  (identified by oid 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3) or the eku  any usage  (identified by oid 2.5.29.37.0) should be specified as well.    finally  the   method balks when it encounters other relevant critical eku's.    so i expect that your wildcard ssl certificate specifies at least one eku that is not  code signing  and therefore is not recognized as a valid code signing certificate by the java plugin.  
 try to modify manifest  adding your server name into caller-allowable-codebase. probably you don't need to add your site url into exception anymore     update :    this is an example of my manisfest file:

 if all subclasses are in the same package you could make   package private to avoid it being extended by any class in other packages.         subclass in the same package:         extension in other package:         the problem with this is  that   is not visible at all in other packages. in above example  the import statement and the variable declaration fail too. it still might be a solution for your special case.  
 all unit tests should be self verifying without human intervention.  ideally it should also be able to run \"headless\" without anything other than a commandline terminal (no gui).    since you are providing the input image.  the test should also provide a correct thumbnail file to compare against.

 the  id3 algorithm  finishes in one of three scenarios:      every element in the subset belongs to the same class (+ or -)  then the node is turned into a leaf and labelled with the class of the examples   there are no more attributes to be selected  but the examples still do not belong to the same class (some are + and some are -)  then the node is turned into a leaf and labelled with the most common class of the examples in the subset   there are no examples in the subset  this happens when no example in the parent set was found to be matching a specific value of the selected attribute  for example if there was no example with age >= 100. then a leaf is created  and labelled with the most common class of the examples in the parent set.      take  for example outlook: sunny and humidity: high/normal. there are three \"high\" rows  and they all say no to tennis. therefore  the first scenario occurs  and leaves can be created. there is more information  but it's not needed in order to make a decision.

 if you get   at    have you checked whether the object   itself has been properly initialized? assuming it is java.awt.desktop you are using  verify if you have checked both  1. whether desktop is supported on your platform and  2. whether open action is supported    you can do this as follows  before the call to  .         if you have initialized it properly as above and still get    the the file is null (as per docs). but since   returns true in your case  check the desktop initialization as shown above.

 one of the probable solution is to first find the center coordinates of the map by using         this will return the latlang object. then you can compare the distance of the center with each of the position markers (that represents cities) using the  google distance matrix api   find out the min by using a mindist() method and return the coordinates of marker at minimum distance  (which is the name of the city)    hope that would help!!!

 you are unlikely to get anything useful from analyzing assembly code generated by jvm. if you are worrying about performance  this is the wrong approach. you cannot reason about high-level performance by measuring low level details. this probably worked well for first programs where you could count cycles by hand. nowadays computers are much more complicated - especially when you are using high-level language such as java. thing you need to take into account include:      garbage collector pauses   jit with various optimizations   multiple levels of instruction and data caches.   branch prediction.      those mechanisms and interactions between them are not something you can easily predict. there is only one sane way to write fast programs i know:      write some part of the program.   identify that it is indeed too slow.   identify and fix bottle necks.   goto #1.      to identify bottle necks i usually start with jvisualvm and go for some more low-level tools if necessary:       perf     strace     -xx jvm diagnostics       in 99% of cases the issue is slow algorithm  wrong data structure  inefficient disk access or something stupid like left over debug logs. less often micro-optimizations like avoiding unnecessary copy or memory allocations will help. in rare circumstances  if everything else fails and you need to squeeze a few cycles out of some tight loop  it might be worth to look at the generated assembly.   might be useful in that case. you want to start with tools that are most likely to help you.  
 to get jvm's assembly code you can use  printassembly  parameter. it gives a readable code with comments  pointing to lines in java sources. so you can clearly understand how your java code is compiled. but i think  looking at processor instructions is very hard to understand bottle necks. for this purpose i have used visualvm and jprofiler.  
      this may do the trick       
 how about something like this       
 to avoid calling   on collection of elements with different types you can use visitor pattern.  
 you can create an interface  &amp; can also use factory method for your token.    public class tokenfactory{         }    public interface itoken {         }    public class internaltoken implements itoken{         }    public class externaltoken implements itoken{         }         // just a demo example for your understanding. hope it will help you. thanks :)  
 first things first:    are you sure  there are no dependency conflicts in your project?     if not  [as per your comments]    you can try one more thing  extract the jar and place the extracted files within your code [i know it's the worst solution to do] but just for the sake of getting close to know what exactly is wrong.    also  as you have mentioned that class is marked as package level visibility so you can not really use it outside the package.  
 starting and stopping of your server/application is not part of running your test classes. so you have to start your application before the test and shutdown after the test manually. so if you want to run your tests automatically you also have to start and stop your server and application automatically.    to do so:      bind the start of your server/application to the pre-integration-test phase of the maven-lifecylce   bind the selenium-plugin to the integration-test phase   bind the shutdown of server/application to the post-integration-test phase of the maven-lifecycle       introduction to the maven build lifecycle  gives you a good understanding of the different phases a build consists of.    moreover i would recommend you not to run the tests against your localhost. instead choose a machine - maybe a virtual host - that you can startup and shutdown as you need it.

 let' s take a look at this method from   class:     public runnable getcallback ()         retrieve callback object that will execute when this message is   handled. this object must implement runnable.  this is called by the   target handler that is receiving this message to dispatch it. if not   set  the message will be dispatched to the receiving handler's   handlemessage(message) .      and what you have called to obtain a           so because you set the callback    is not called :-)  
 as it is on your screenshot  you have nothing inside of your  .    to add things to the   in scene builder you need to either click and drag the thing you want onto the visual part  or onto the   that you show us a screenshot of. the   element in the list will \"highlight\" with an orange border to indicate what element in the hierarchy you're attempting to add elements.    remember that you need to save your scene builder document for the changes to show in you fxml document  and vice versa. scene builder should detect changes to the fxml file and should prompt you to load the changes made to the fxml file onto your scene builder project.  
 set a boolean   when you get the location from gps:         and when you make your request like      add below a   with 30 seconds of delay like this:       
 you can use a handler's postdelay method to do the timer. try       
 instead of   try   (first). this still creates (and returns) a    but takes your   into account while doing so.  
 if you just want to confirm the installation you can check that in eclipse as below.    in eclipse go to windows --> preferences --> maven --> installations    there you can find if eclipse uses internal maven from your suite or any external maven is being pointed. you can as well add or delete any new maven versions if you want to.  
  guava :            the fancy version would be         where the precomputation returns a faster matcher.  
 you should try using regex        
 first of all  removes a this.name.contains(\"a\") because is duplicate     then you can try switch (jdk7)       
 you want to generalize over the series of characters that could be in the name:       
 without any external libraries: use regex matching / pattern matching: i.e. \"does my string match any of said characters\"?       
 it depends of the misfireinstructionpolicy you have chosen. this typically depends on how you have built your schedule (cronschedule  simpleschedule  etc...).    have a look at the related documentation:       cronschedulebuilder     simplescheduler     calendarintrervalschedulebuilder     dailytimeintervalschedulebuilder       ps: links point to the first method of for misfireinstructions but there are several available on each schedule.  
 where did the abstract class come from?    jaxb would generate an abstract class to correspond to an abstract complex type in the xml schema.  in the example below the complex type   would correspond to an abstract class called    also the generated class   would have a property of this type.         how to set a property that is an abstract type    for a property of this type you set the value to be one of the concrete subclasses.         or         how to decide which subclass to use?        how do decide which of the concrete subclasses to use?      there isn't really an automated way to do this  you need to make a specific choice based on the data you are trying to represent. in the example above if you want the customer to be contacted by mail you set an instance of   otherwise you set an instance of  .       update        i did try using one of the concrete subclasses and it works like you   said. the downside is that these concrete subclasses are not really   related to the setter method that i'm using. an example i can think of   is setappointmentdate(staffleavedates). here staffleavedates extends   availabledates as a concrete subclass but is not really anything to do   with an appointment date but it still works. do you think this is the   best i can do? i'm just thinking that it could look confusing.      jaxb is going to enable you to create any xml document that is compatible with your xml schema.  as far as it is concerned you told it (via the xml schema) to allow any type that extends   so it will happily accept  .  you can try and change your xml schema so it is more restrictive (see example below).     xml schema     below is an updated version of the xml schema that introduces a new subtype of   called   that i don't want to ever be used as a value on the   property on  .  so i have changed   to have a choice between   and  .          generated model     now my   class can hold onto an   or   (or both unfortuately)  but not an  .  whatever property is null won't be marshalled to xml.       
 i found the answer. the problem is that we must add some logic between \"prepare-package\" and \"package\" phases. as we user maven-war-plugin we can do it using   goal. from official docs:        create an exploded webapp in a specified directory.      and here it's necessary to remember one important thing that maven after version 2.0.1 copies resources twice so if we want to use maven 2.5 we must use  . so final solution:       
 you are appending the output of first with next one in line here:         you should either return array of strings or you should add a new line something like:       
 put your println into view.         change it to.         since your iterating all values.          edit  or remove the loop if you want to print it on 'r'.         also used add \"\ \" like what @almas shaikh said  
 after some optimizations  now it takes around 15 seconds to generate the database. after all the research and tests  the most important thigs are:       use only one transaction for all the inserts  and the transaction has to be declared explicitally. if it is not declared  by default it creates one new transaction for each insert.     create one and only one preparedstatement to do all the inserts and reuse it as much as possible.     
 xlsql's principle is a little complex  it uses hsqldb or mysql as sql engines  creates related databases and tables with data from excels files  then executes queries over the database. it treats:         so it accesses a table using a schema prefix. for example:         here \"demo\" is the excel file name without extension  xlsqly7 is the sheet name. in \"xlsql-y8.zip\" or \"xlsql-y7.zip\"   there is an example \"testxlsql.java\". i also wrote another one:         another constraint is that the first row of a sheet must be column names which must start with a uppercase letter  or the sheet will be considered invalidate.     this is the best document about xlsql:  http://blog.csdn.net/ailvey/article/details/8779119   unfortunately  it is written in chinese.  
 you have to edit the   file and update the   property to point to the jdk you want.    everything is documented in this   file.  
 the solution was jira webworks. but apparently all tutorials are a bit vague at some points. i recommend using the atlassian example code that they provide. it is much more useful than any tutorial out there including their own.     jirawebactionsupport is very important (implement a class deriving from it for example) where you define http responses and/or the use of a velocity script in the doexecute(). all methods from that class can be called from the velocity script by \"$action.mymethod()\". this is also possible with other fields though i guess a string return type or simple return types are the only usable types.     these were for me the relevant problems/questions. i hope someone else will find this useful.    regards chris  
 have you tried opening this link in the browser and see what happens.i received this :         if you are sure it is a firewall issue you need to ask your network admin to whitelist this address.    otherwise not recommended though  try setting up an http proxy to bypass the firewall.    i would also suggest using   instead of the base class.  
 you have to configure the web.xml like below:         got it from  http://www.roytuts.com/integrate-struts-2-in-liferay-portlet/   
 if you could use java 8           make stream from array   map each array elementy into two element array (spliting)   collect it to map with custom merge function      // edit:    add duplicates elimination. it's just an example. you should make your own strategy to eliminate duplicates (if you need some specific).    // edit 2: after comment by @zouzou change impl into that use custom merge function     // edit 3: if you couldn't use java 8 then use guava:         beacause common   impl use key and value in   we need custom class.    then we could create something like:           transform each element to our     make     rewrite to      
 both have o(n) complexity. to have significant difference in speed you would need very very big   array.    as commenters have pointed out you can optimize it slightly by storing both parameters of split in array and then put them into map. it is not really clear if you will get any notable speed increase by doing this (my guess is that you will probably not gain that much speed).  
 i would go with your first implementation as substring would be much faster and efficient (you just go over characters once until you find equal to symbol ) than split which will be based on pattern matching and as describe  here .  
 you could use   to get your  .       
 you need jdk 8 to compile the project.(pom file in path:\" spring-mvc-quickstart-archetype/src/main/resources/archetype-resources/pom.xml \" force you to have jdk 8 installed).  
 here is a sketch for a solution       
 try to implement a custom trust manager  so that it checks your custom certificates and if this fails android builtin certificates.    have a look at this article:  using a custom certificate trust store on android .    i think the paragraph \"creating a dynamic trustmanager\" handles exactly what you are asking.  
      but can't find how to use it.       you need to execute the equivalent of  db.runcommand()  in java:          filemd5  calculates the md5 hash of a single document identified by the   of the document  in the collection specified by the   parameter.  
 the more important question is which jre version you are going to use to run your old code.     using a newer version (even it the code only uses syntax and classes of the old version) has the benefit of taking advantage of all the bug fixes and performance improvements that the newer version should have.    as for using the older or newer compiler  i think it makes sense to assume the newer compiler would produce more efficient byte code  so i'd use the newer compiler even if the code remains unchanged.  
 from a technical perspective  the difference should be small  if any. the only bytecode op that has been added since 1.3 is invokedynamic  which 1.3 code won't use anyway. optimization normally takes place in the jit compiler  rather than in the byte code compiler  so it's unlikely that any changes there will improve performance.    however  if you're rebuilding it every now and then  i assume you're still doing at least some maintenance work on the code. it might be a good idea to move forward to a new version  preemptively  since older source levels eventually may become deprecated with future jdks. the only things i can think of that can break are variables using names which have since become reserved words (  for example)  but once it compiles it should work fine.    long story short  i'd recommend you to test bumping the source level and see what happens. odds are it'll work just fine.  
 you need to set the environment variable java_home.         if you want to make the change permantent you can add this line to  .  
 your problem is this block here:         you're writing the chart picture into a byte array  but then trying to add some random file to the word document  which is never going to work!    instead  pass the chart picture into the word document  which should be fine  something like:         the difference here is that after capturing the bytes of your picture  you then give those same bytes to poi to add into your document. you need to give the picture itself  otherwise it won't work!  
 1) you doing it wrong. you shouldn't create   directly by using  .     2) you should open new activity using   and set arguments to it.         and in   get it:          upd:  if you are using   just like utility class  make   static:         and call it:          upd:  as answered  here   you cannot do this. when you refer a layout file using    the android system looks for this in your current   only. (i.e the view which you have set using   for the current activity).  
 my reasons are      global access to that query. if you write inline query  you may need to copy paste.   your code looks beautiful. those big big queries in source code looks ugly.   maintenance will be easy. if you scatter your queries everywhere in code  later it's hard to maintain them.      and i usually place respective queries in respective bean mapping file.  
     you can try -  modelandview.setviewname(\"redirect:/cardproducer\");        // in my project i have used  tiles  for templating    
 i think your redirect is not going back to root. when you redirect via    i am guessing that it is just appending this to your current uri  producing something like  . it is redirecting to this  which is picked up by the delete controller  and redirects again and again.    instead  you need to redirect back to root. something with a beginning slash like  .    you should be able to open the console in your browser and see what the location header values are (the redirect uris).  
 you can cat the   of the fields like so:       
 you can use   to tell the objects apart.       
 if you need to test if an object is from your project  you can look at the package name and compare it to your project's package name.    you can either do this on the declared type of the field or on the runtime type of the field contents. the snippet below demonstrates the latter approach:         do remember that   only returns publicly-accessible fields. you may want to consider   as i've done above. if you stick with    you can omit the accessibility code in the above example.  
 with a bit of work  you could distinguish your classes by the classloader that loaded them. take a look at this:     find where java class is loaded from     though this could help  it's not going to be the silver bullet for your problem  mainly because:      primitives (byte  short  char  int  long  float  double  and boolean) are not classes.   the architecture of classloaders is different in different app servers.   the same class could be loaded many times by different classloaders.    
 what i understood is you what to go recursive in object hierarchy and get values of primitives          i got output as       
 the item might be null because the map.get did not return anything (the outer map does not exist) or because the inner map does not contain the requested object. therefor  a second check is performed to detect the actual reason   became null.  
 it looks like you have a map within a map.         if   is not null  this means that   is found in the outer map and   is found in the inner map.    however  if   is null  it's still possible that   key exists in the outer map  which means the containskey check if necessary.  
 as the other answers stated  you need to keep this check. however this is a bad coding actually  because there are multiple reasons which are unrelated for the   instance to be null (and hence the second check in the first if statement).     you better have to split it to make the intent more clear (and avoid confusions when others are reading your code).         or another variant:         the point is that the programmer who wrote this ternary nested statement though that it would be less code but at the end  you see that it's just confusing. always write readable code!   
 the problem was hidden in my firmware  so reinstall solved the problem.  
 in snapshot make the field that links to the other table (i suppose it's called row1) unique.         edit: you can not control how many other tables are using your primary key. what you can do is introduce a new table where you manage your linking. there you coudl have to columns one called link_from and the other one link_to and make link_to unique.  
 as your question is currently written  this is just a wild guess of what could happen.    the position of your   loop suggests the following logic for your server (pseudo-code) :         that would be wrong. there can be many component in a network that will abort an inactive connection  because it holds unused resources.    you should use :         that way the connection is properly closed instead of remaining inactive and the client opens an clean connection for each new transaction.  
 i think there is some changes for the new api.    below should be the correct one        
 okay. i will take a run at this.    there are a couple of major reasons to use event emitters.     one of the main reasons is that the browser  which is where javascript was born  sometimes forces you to. whether you are wiring your events straight into your html  using jquery or some other framework/library  or whatever  the underlying code is still basically the same (erm  basically...)     so first  if you want to react to a keyboard or mouse event  like you mentioned  you could just hard bind directly to an event handler (callback) like this:         ...or you could do the exact same thing in js by dom reference:         this used to be the primary way we wired up click handlers. one lethal drawback to this pattern is that you can only attach one callback to each dom event. if you wanted to have a second callback that reacted to the same event  you would either need to combine write it into the existing click handler or build a delegate function to handle the job of calling the two functions. plus  your event emitter ends up being tightly coupled to the event listener  and that is generally a bad thing.    as applications became more complex  it makes more sense to use event listeners  instead. browser vendors (eventually) settled on a single way to do this:         the advantage to this pattern is that you can attach multiple handlers to a single dom event  or call one single event handler from several different dom events. the  disadvantage is that you have to be careful not to leak: depending on how you write them  event-handling closures (like   above) can continue to exist after the dom element to which they were attached have been destroyed and gced. this means it is good practice to always do a  . (some libraries have an   method that does the same thing).    this pattern works well for keyboard events as well:         okay. so that is how you usually handle native browser events. but developers also like to use this pattern of event delegation in their own code. the reason you would want to do this is so you can decouple your code as much as possible.    for example  in a ui  you could have an event emitted every time the user's browser goes offline (you might watch   for example). maybe you could have a green/red lamp on your page header to show the online state  and maybe you could disable all submit buttons when offline  and maybe also show a warning message in the page footer. with event listeners/emitters  you could write all of these as completely decoupled modules and they still can work in lock-step. and if you need to refactor your ui  you can remove one component (the lamp  for example)  replace it with  something else without worrying about screwing up the logic in some other module.    as another example  in a node app you might want your database code to emit an error condition to a particular controller and also log the error -- and maybe send out an email. you can see how these sorts of things might get added iteratively. with event listeners  this sort of thing is easy to do.    you can either write your own  or you can use whatever pattern is available in your particular environment. jquery  angular  ember and node all have their particular methods  but you are free to also build your own -- which is what i would encourage you to try.    these are all variations of the same basic idea and there is a lot of blur over the exact definition or most correct implementation (in fact  some might question if these are different at all). but here are the main culprits:       observer     pub-sub     mediator     
 you can use the initial capacity to save the need to re-size the   while appending to it  which costs time.     if you know if advance how many characters would be appended to the   and you specify that size when you create the    it will never have to be re-sized while it is being used.    if  on the other hand  you don't give an initial capacity  or give a too small intial capacity  each time that capacity is reached  the storage of the   has to be increased  which involves copying the data stored in the original storage to the larger storage.  
 the string builder has to store the string that is being built somewhere. it does so in an array of characters. the capacity is the length of this array. once the array would overflow  a new (longer) array is allocated and contents are transferred to it. this makes the capacity rise.    if you are not concerned about performance  simply ignore the capacity. the capacity might get interesting once you are about to construct huge strings and know their size upfront. then you can request a string builder with a capacity being equal to the expected size (or slightly larger if you are not sure about the size).    example when building a string with a content size of 1 million:         initializing the string builder with one million will make it faster in comparison to a default string builder which has to copy its array repeatedly.  
   is  backed  by an array of characters. the default capacity is   + the length of the string argument. if you append to the stringbuilder and the number of characters cannot be fit in the array  then the capacity will have to be changed which will take time. so  if you have some idea about the the number of characters that you might have   initialize the capacity .   
 the answer is:  performance . as the other answers already say  stringbuilder uses an internal array of  some original size (capacity). every time the building up string gets to large for the array to hold it  stringbuilder has to allocate a new  larger array  copy the data from the previous array to the new one and delete the previous array.    if you know beforehand what size the resulting string might be and pass that information to the constructor  stringbuilder can create a large enough array right away and thus can avoid the allocating and copying.    while for small strings  the performance gain is negelectible  it make quite a difference if you build really large strings.  
 i was able to reproduce the issue in netbeans 7.3.1. the problem appears to be related to  bug #224770 . the fix summary is  #224770: making handling of new with enclosing expression more similar to vanilla javac  while preserving the correct outputs from the api.     you have two options.      upgrade netbeans to 7.4 or newer. i tested the code in 7.4 and it worked properly.    keep using netbeans 7.3  and don't use \"this.new\". change line 11 to this:    b = new inner2() {     
 assuming you are using the java-based configuration of spring security  you can just let your filter be spring managed and add it at the start of the spring security filter chain (heavily inspired from example in the httpsecurity javadoc (see below for a link):         see  http://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-security/current/apidocs/org/springframework/security/config/annotation/web/builders/httpsecurity.html#addfilter(javax.servlet.filter)  for details on this.  
 who are the users of this?    if you ask your users to log into their instagram account  and authorize your app  then you can make 5000 requests per hour per user:     http://instagram.com/developer/limits/     if you just use your key  you are limited to 5000 requests per hour  no matter how many users you have.  
 your just appending the text here:         you should append after summation of variable sum.         also the append value should be 'sum' not 'value';  
 you have to put          inside your generate method and it will work as expected.    otherwise you'll be passing only a reference to the array and next time you'll be overwriting the very same array.    also  the other two arrays don't need to be initialized  since they will be assigned the newly created array.  
 the problem is that   should be a local variable instead of a class variable.  
 here i am assuming that you are trying to import java templates       if xml file begins with   then it is for 'code templates' location: windows -> preferences -> java -> code style -> code templates     if xml file begins with                 then these are for formatter    location: windows -> preferences -> java -> code style -> formatter      if xml file begins with               location: windows -> preferences -> java -> code style -> clean up      for .epf files  select file -> import -> general -> preferences (now select file) and follow the steps.    
 based on the description of your data structures  you have to iterate over the entire   list to find the two nodes of the requested names.    you can make the search more efficient if you maintain a   that gives you a   by its name. however  that's really unnecessary.    instead  i would suggest that your   class hold references to its two  s instead of the names of those nodes. not only would it require less storage  it would also prevent the need to search for a node by name.    change your edge to :         then you code would be as simple as :       
 memory usage you observe is due to buffer recycling that uses per-thread   to hold on to couple of parsing buffers (a   one  another  ) one. these will be reclaimed if there is memory pressure; but as long as there is plenty of heap  they are retained and reused. this can be significant performance improvement  as such buffers need not be allocated  cleared  and gc'ed.    so it should not be a problem -- this is similar to disk caching that os does  using memory blocks for disk cache when there is memory to spare.  
 it is injected. check persistence.xml for persistence unit with name mydatabase. that's the config for this object.  
 if the question is if the entitymanager can be created without any implementation of a entity manager factory from your side then the answer is yes. you just need a persistence-unit named \"mydatabase\" in your persistence.xml  
 you should simply add a iselectionlistener by using the iselectionservice. there is also a nice article about that topic ->  https://eclipse.org/articles/article-workbenchselections/article.html     for project state changes you must add a iresourcechangelistener.    iworkspace#addresourcechangelistener(iresourcechangelistener  int)  
 have a look at     https://eclipse.org/articles/article-workbenchselections/article.html     1) create your own class implementing iselectionchangedlistener.    2) call addselectionchangedlistener(iselectionchangedlistener yourlistener) on the selection provider you want to listen to:         3) process your selection events  
 it may be a bug  see:  http://openssl.6102.n7.nabble.com/1-1-0-dev-aes-gcm-on-command-line-quot-bad-decrypt-quot-but-seems-to-work-td49979.html   even this does not entirely work:       
     i copied the base64 output into a file (test-in)  and tried decrypting it using the following command ...      authenticated encryption modes do not work from the command line tools. from the    man page :        the enc program does not support authenticated encryption modes like   ccm and gcm. the utility does not store or retrieve the authentication   tag.      i know the documentation was recently updated (circa may or june 2014) with the statement above. the mailing list message that triggered it was  v1.0.1g command line gcm error .    i don't know if newer versions of the tools (like   in 1.0.2 or 1.1.0) provide a meaningful error message  or if you just get   bad decrypt  .           what i'm doing wrong?      nothing.  
 it doesn't matter whether the mutex is static or non-static  as long as it is the same object.     to answer your first question  the   object would be the same for all of your threads  therefore no two threads would be able to acquire a lock on it at the same time.    the second question is more tricky... if the object in the   block is the same for all of your threads then they would perform like they did in the previous scenario. if each thread has it own object then there would be nothing preventing all of your thread from entering the critical section at a time.    also  remember that there's a huge chance that when you call   t1 might already have finished processing (same might happen to your other threads) so make sure that you don't get fooled by what you see being printed on the console...  
  what would be the effect of using static reference/object in synchronized block (as in example#3)     the static object is shared between the threads  and thus all threads that will block when one thread acquires the lock.  meaning if t1 is inside the synchronized block then t2  t3  ...  t6 are blocked.     but  there is a trick in the code you provided.   this will create a new num object since the integer class is immutable. so what will happen  say t1 acquires the lock and enters the synchronized block. now  t1 executes  . now many cases could happen.       if another thread was blocked before num++ was executed this thread will remain block until t1 exits the sychronized block.   if a thread was not blocked (say t2) and num++ was executed by t1  then t2 will not block since the num is now a new integer. thus the lock is different  and t2 enters the block acquiring the lock for the new integer.       and the same story can happen with all the threads.  in fact  it is possible to have all the threads in the synchronized block at the same time.      what would be the effect of using non-static reference/object in synchronized block.     assuming that non-static object is not shared between the instances of the class bar  thus only one thread of t1 t2 t3 can be in the synchronized block. similarly for t4 t5 t6. however  if it is shared it has the same effect as a static object.     also does the static reference num in synchronized block (synchronized(num)) is equivalent to synchronized(bar.class) ?     it is if you don't change num as i explained in the answer to the first question  
 before going to your question you will need to understand the below points.    all the above synchronization will have different level of mutex in object or class level.     what is mutex     in java  every object has one and only one monitor and mutex associated with it. the single monitor has several doors into it  however  each indicated by the synchronized keyword. when a thread passes over the synchronized keyword  it effectively locks all the doors. of course  if a thread doesn't pass across the synchronized keyword  it hasn't locked the door  and some other thread is free barge in at any time. source :  click here      synchronization block with  /synchronized instance method       mutex will be applied on a current object.    mutext will be shared across all  instance method .           for eg : thread_1 &amp; thread_2 are call methods   and   respectively. so either one of the thread will wait for others. thread_3 calls method   or   it will wait as per earlier statement.     synchronization block with  /synchronized static method         mutex will be applied on the class object of that class.    mutext will be shared across all  static method .           thread_1 &amp; thread_2 are call methods   and   respectively. so either one of the thread will wait for others. thread_3 calls method   or   it will wait as per earlier statement.across all object of that class and static reference have same mutex for those  static methods .    note : synchronized instance method will have mutex on object level. so it will not affect above condition.      synchronization block with  .         mutex will apply on a user defined object in instance level.    one mutex object will be used one or more instance method.           if thread_1 and thread_2 call a and b respectively. both will granted to do. if thread_3 calls   or  . it will be waiting for thread_1 completes. so we can define lock in each method in instance level.      synchronization block with  .         mutex will apply on a user defined object in class level.    one mutex object will be used one or more instance method.            it will same just like instanse reference. but mutex will same across all instance of the class.  so if thread_1   thread_2 calls   method   only one thread_1 will acquire lock. other will wait. because its class level.  
 it is very unwise to develop your own encryption algorithms. it might be useful only as a school exercise. otherwise it could be dangerous!    however  if you really have to do it on your own  have a look at some existing source code as inspiration:     https://www.bouncycastle.org/     or read the technical specification of the cipher you want to implement  aes for example:     http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf

 yes  given that you are using the intellij test runner (rather than running the tests via maven)  you can use the  rerun failed tests  function.     https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/rerunning-tests.html     edit: based on your comment  can i suggest you run the single test you are working on in \"debug\" mode  this won't erase the history of your compelte test suite  and you can do that in in combination with the  rerun failed tests  as needed.

 when you call static method of another class specified class name            because compiler cannot find a   method in class   because it's exist in    class    for example in your code you have a statement  .   is the class name and   is a static method in it .so you call it    
 how you call the methods checkdigit(zip); are wrong  checkdigit(zip) is a static method so it means it is owned by that class where you create it. so     you can access it by          or you can extend   since you are calling it inside your main which is also a static :       
 you have to add teh class name in front of the method:         must be        
 maybe the string does not ends in   maybe after the comma there is a blank space  tab or something. try:       
 replace your code with      system.out.println(\"befor  remove comma :\"+sbf);             string sbf1 = sbf.tostring().substring(0  sbf.length() - 5);              system.out.println(\"sbf1 rishi--->\"+sbf1);             if (sbf1.trim().endswith(\" \")) {                 sbf1 = sbf1.trim().substring(0  sbf1.length() - 1);                  sbf1+=\"\";                  system.out.println(\"after removing comma  the string is :\"+sbf1);             } because your string ends with &lt; / a>. sorry bro  lunch time. so just a dirty trick.     final edit :     your problme is not the commas  but the way you are appending them. change your code with the modified code i am providing.       
 even if you ignore the \" one test  one assertion \" purist perspective  i think most people agree you should split tests that involve error conditions from tests that prove normal behaviour.    if you want to test multiple error conditions within one test (or if you're really keen on continuing with your plan)  you can use this pattern:       
 if that's your entire configuration  there's nothing there that will inherently take a \"long time\".    i suggest you turn on debug logging and follow the message flow (request and reply) to see where the delay is.    post back here if you see something we should look at  but i don't see anything in the above configuration.  
 setting the  transient  property of the eattribute will prevent it from being serialized (it will be reset to the default value when read)  which is basically the same effect as the   keyword in java serialization.

  jdbc support for pl/sql data types as parameters  is a new feature of oracle 12c.    pl/sql types look and act like regular types; they can be used in sql and other contexts  they have a type_oid and typecode  and they have a data dictionary view (dba_plsql_types).  one odd difference is that pl/sql types do not show up in dba_objects.    in older versions you must create a type as a stand-alone object in order to use it outside of pl/sql.  code like this can create the objects:       
 you could make use of a little-known feature in pl/sql:   functions. an example:         the above will yield:         so you can materialise the table type also easily from jdbc.    the reason for this is the fact that every pipelined function implicitly creates a top-level sql type that is of the same type as your pl/sql table type. in the above case something like:         this is more of a side-note. in general  you should probably prefer  the approach suggested by jon heller

 in playscreen's constructor  you create a   which will have its own viewport and camera. then you give that camera to the tiled map renderer.    but then in    you create a new   which will replace the reference that was created in the constructor. so when you are changing the camera in    it is the camera from the new stage  not the old camera that the tiled map renderer is still using.    you'll want to avoid using   in the   method anyway  because then you'll be creating a new stage every time the screen changes  which will waste time creating a new sprite batch (which takes up a lot of memory and compiles a shader each time). and the old stage that you replace each time will leak because it's not having   called on it before its reference is lost.    i'm not sure of your constraints  but one solution would be to revise your   method to this:         a couple of other things... you should dispose of your stage in   to avoid potential leaks (the sprite batch in the stage will leak a shader when the screen changes if you don't). and your camera movements should always involve multiplying by   so the movement speed is framerate independent.

 see this question:         wrapper class missing when using xjc on xsd       you don't get a class for   because jaxb handles it via the   construct.    you can  however  customize   to generate a class via the   customization. but still  that class will not have the fields  it will be just a wrapper class.    see also:         how to generate @xmlrootelement classes for base types in xsd?     
 i thinks there is no way in java api so that you can  process a list of patterns.  so better way for you would be take list of pattern and process it accordingly.     ex:         
 putting an element into a new array does not clone that element. so any changes to that element will still affect the original. you have to call   on the element in order to clone it. do that at the time of adding to the array:       
 put the .jar argument first         make sure both \"apples.class\" and \"manifest.jar\" are in the current directory.    i would also encourage you to:    1) use packages (instead of the default package)    2) capitalize your class names (\"apples.java\" instead of \"apples\")    here's a nice  short tutorial that might help:     http://www.mkyong.com/java/how-to-add-your-manifest-into-a-jar-file/   
 your   uses a different instance of   from the   in  . (notice there are two places where   is called.) so calling   won't affect the instance of   used by  .    but if you did this:         and then used the following in  :         then things should behave as you expect.  
 you could use regex:         this asserts 15 by:      any non-zero hours value   or    any hours value with minutes:    starting with \"1\" then \"5-9\" - ie 15 to 19 minutes   starting with a number greater than \"1\" - ie 20 to 59 minutes       
 declaring the class as   means that whatever thread wants to execute the method must first acquire the current object's lock.  the object has exactly one lock and only the thread that has obtained it can execute the method.  other threads must wait until the lock-holding thread is done.  upon completion of the method  the executing thread releases the lock.    in short. the   keyword ensures that at any given time  only one thread can execute the method.    synchronization is important on classes where (a) the system is multi-threaded; (b) the class has instance variables that can be changed within the method.  multi-threading issues typically occur when two or more threads are executing the same method simultaneously.  one thread can change an instance variable based on its inputs  and those changes are seen by the other thread.    in this particular example  a problem could arise with the instance variable  .  if one thread sets it to say 5  a second thread could come along and set it to 10.  when the first thread then executes the system.out.println call  it prints a value of 10 - which is unexpected behavior.  
 the   keyword prevents threada  threadb  and threadc from executing the operations at the same time. it's important to understand that   is internally implement as three operations:      read count field   add value   write count field      if you remove the   keyword  then you can imagine the following sequence of events:      threada reads count field (0)   threadb reads count field (0)   threada adds value to count (count=0 from #1 + value=1 for example)   threadb adds value to count (count=0 from #2 + value=1 for example)   threada writes count field (1 from #3)   threadb writes count field (1 from #4 (!)  so the write operation in #5 is lost)    
 the reason that making the   method synchronised is important is that this line:         is not an atomic action. it a really compiles as this (or similar):         which should be pretty obviously  not  threadsafe.  
 if due to a bug in the product  i doubt this is a ce-specific issue. as for the warning you point to in the screenshot  this isn't something to be overly worried about. there is a long standing  issue for this   this is something that should be cleaned up  but in practice it poses no problem.    however  i don't remember ever seeing an issue where having just multiple users access the system causes that type of issue. as in my answer to your  other question  where you describe a similar symptom  i'd really recommend you look at the  . in general the root cause for the issue can be found there. and again  if you can't quite figure out what the issue is based on what you have in    feel free to post that file somewhere  link to it in a comment  and we'll try to see if we can find something for you.  
 so you want to convert your table of data to this;         right?  
 ok  here you go... its not very pretty and it relies on your data being in a specific structure but here's a simple bit of javascript to extract the json. hope this give you a place to start at least.         ...and here's the jsfiddle -  http://jsfiddle.net/0hhkqq1d/     enjoy!  
 here is an answer using  jsoup  and  json  as dependencies:          output (formatted):       
 i see a number of problems:      you check both  a  2  +  b  2  =  c  2  and  b  2  +  a  2  =  c  2   but these are actually equivalent   you never check if  a  2  +  c  2  =  b  2 .   you use   to square a number  which is both inefficient and imprecise. (you should just use  .)   you expect floating-point arithmetic to give an  exact  value &mdash; suitable for   &mdash; which it generally does not.    
 floating-point numbers are not exact  and comparisons using   will often fail. you should instead take the absolute difference between the two numbers and make sure it's very small:         you can use a different threshold from   if you want.  
 if your method   is supposed to to compute the answer from 3 floating point values  it will never work  because as others have pointed out you will get inaccuracies in your calculations. you may be happy to settle for a \"close enough\" approach like chris jester-young's.    however  your triangles are specified using integer coordinates  so you don't need to use floating-point values. you can either do it using the  squares  of the three sides (as these will be integers) or you can do it by using gradients to see if any 2 sides are perpendicular. as this is a programming site rather than a maths site i won't give the details but it's possible to do it just using   addition  subtraction and multiplication  but  if you are smart  no division.     
 you didn't mentioned that how you are calculating      and   assuming those are correct you second check in your function is same as first function there is no difference. so correct version would be        
 first of all  you should initialize your gui elements inside your   method  never during declaration:         in order to write to the external storage  you also need the proper permission to be registered inside your   file:        
 you can't initialize your views in declaration part. it must be on   methods. so move this lines         on   method.  
 i think you can do this with plink  i think it will capture stdout to your terminal  don't quote me on that though. i can't currently test for you as i only have a linux machine to hand.         if not get a proper sftp client which should let you do what you need.    if you get the basic case working i'd recommend pulling the archives and extracting locally. it will be faster as text compresses well and it will be easier to control input/output filenames.  
 those sorting algorithms are all working fine. (given the varying style of comments  i gather that you collected those from different sources on the internet or from books.)    the problem is that you are  calling  them the wrong way. note that those different methods have different parameters: some require just the data to be sorted  some the length of the data  some the length minus one. this information can be found in the documentation at the top of each of the methods.    try this   method for testing the individual sorts:       
 answer to question 1:    you have plugin executions defined that  m2eclipse  does not really know what to do with. it knows what to do with default executions (how to compile  pull resources together  that kind of stuff)  not your custom things. you will have to tell it what to do  which pretty much comes down to telling it to  execute  or  not  to execute these configured plugin executions. there is three ways to go about this  and i just noticed that i have  answered this before . you can find the official explanation  here .    answer to question 2:    not going to be a clear-cut answer. where is your application looking for the css? perhaps you have to understand the relevant source folders of a war application (assumption that your project is one of those):       : java classes  compiled into   files  will end up in your class path  in   of your war file    : resource files  will end up in your class path  in   of your war file    : resource files  will end up in the root of your web application      in other words: if you were to make a    it will become available on  .    answer to question 3:    not going to be a clear-cut answer. something is holding on to the database. are you sure the application is down? are you having a database tool open to look into the database? don't do that :)  
 i believe the answer to #1 is similar to  an answer i just posted on the mailing list .    you can find more information at the url below.     https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/documentation/m2e-execution-not-covered.html        
 if you are using eclipse then remove the method deceleration in your subclass(stringdictionary ) then compiler will ask you to implement unimplemented method in super class. then with the help of eclipse you use option  .    hope so it will solve your problem.  
 i've tried exactly your code - no problem at all. jdk1.6 should be sufficient  as   for interfaces was added in jdk1.6. from all i can see in the question  your code is correct and should work fine.    i suggest things like restart eclipse or change the method then change it back  it seems something inside eclipse got out of sync with your code.  
 one more suggestion  delete the class file eclipse has generated for you make some edits(like comments) to the file save and let eclipse build again for you.  
 i think jdk 1.7 considers interface methods as implementation rather than override so   throws error.  
 as brian goetz (project lead for java lambdas) says   \"lambda expressions have no intrinsic type\"  (which applies to method references too). this is why you need to cast (or assign) to type   before its methods become available.    the reason eclipse shows different error messages from the jdk compiler (javac) is that eclipse uses its own java compiler  called ecj  which is a totally different program from javac. this is  btw  why eclipse can run on the jre  without needing a full jdk install.  
 you can get away without type casts or temporary variables if you create a   helper method (where all functions are parameters rather than method invocation receivers):         then you can simply say:         however  keep in mind that chaining method references this way is neither shorter in source code nor more efficient at runtime compared to a simple lambda expression:         note how the last solution does not require type casts  additional variables nor helper methods. method references are a good tool if you have an already existing method that fits where a function is required but composing a function out of multiple method references is not really useful (in most cases).  
 this is not possible using  . you either need a custom parser  a different file format  or you need to put some sortable prefix in the keys (      etc.) and then create a   and iterate over it instead.  
 use the below code to maintain order       
 thanks everyone i got a clear solution and thought of sharing it here so that everyone can make use of          using collections i am getting all the keys and storing it in a list and sorting the entire data i got from my property file   
 rename your fields to start with lowercase letters  and your getter and setter methods to correspond. like:         jasper looks for the corresponding getter that respects java convensions.  
 use    and you'll see the first bytecode is what does it:         in other words    is compiled as an   (load constant) bytecode instruction  which references the   class from the constant pool.  
  jls-4.3.2. the class object  says (in part)        the method getclass returns the class object that represents the class of the object.        a   object exists for each reference type. it can be used  for example  to discover the fully qualified name of a class  its members  its immediate superclass  and any interfaces that it implements.        the type of a method invocation expression of   is   where   is the class or interface searched ( §15.12.1 ) for  .        a class method that is declared synchronized ( §8.4.3.6 ) synchronizes on the monitor associated with the   object of the class.     
    
 here:         you want it to be  .    for the future  two rules to avoid errors like this:       use descriptive and meaningful variable names whenever possible (which is to say  pretty much  always)    do not create more variables than you need (for example  in this case  you do not need two iterator variables  could have just reused it). better yet  limit the scope of variables to be as narrow as possible: do not do             do this instead:        
 your last parameter     isn't specifying a number of characters to right justify.  assuming you want it to be 10 characters  like the other parameters  you'd probably want  .  
 please refer to  formatting numeric print output     try    
 your schema does not match the schema of the json string. you need to have a different schema that does not have a union in the place of the error but a decimal number. such schema should then be used as a writer schema while you can freely use the other one as the reader schema.  
 don't use the deprecated methods from the   class. use event listeners instead. you'll want to use   and   in this case.    add   at the top here.         in your init method use the   class's   method.         then override the necessary methods (i.e.  ).    in the   method  use the   class's   method and its fields to do what you need to do.         this is pretty much the standard operation for handling input events such as key events and mouse events. as madprogrammer mentioned above  it's a good idea to use swing tools such as   or    and to use key bindings with them.  
 to answer my own question  it seems jdk 8.25 has a bug in this code:         it compares by   (reference comparison) instead of   method (content comparison). while the string literal   appears to be the same string object in memory as stored by    the string returned by   is clearly a different instance.  that's why   returns true for one  false for other.         you can't change the jdk code  so a workaround is to call   on the variable  and you have a higher chance of being safe against bugs like   comparisons.       
 you could use     and something like         output includes the current method and line number (if debugging was compiled in).  for example        
     i have tried just straight base64 encode  but for some smaller numbers  the encoded string is longer than just storing the number as a string      base64 encoding of byte data will make it longer  by about a third. it is not supposed to make it shorter  but to allow safe transport of binary data in formats that are not binary safe.    however  base 64 is more compact than  decimal   even if it is less compact than base 256 (byte data). encoding your numbers in base 64 directly will make them more compact. this will do it:         using this encoding scheme    will be the string    which is 11 characters long  compared to its decimal representation   which is 19 characters long. numbers up to about 16 million will fit in a mere 4 characters. that's about as short as you'll get it. (technically there are two other characters which do not need to be encoded in urls:    and   . you can incorporate those to get base 66  which would be a smidgin shorter for some numbers  although that seems a bit pedantic.)  
 assuming that you don't do any compression  and that you restrict yourself to url safe characters  then the following procedure will give you the most compact encoding possible.      make a list of all url safe characters   count them.  suppose you have n.   represent your number in base n  representing 0 by the first character  1 by the 2nd and so on.         so  what about compression ...    if you assume that the numbers you are representing are uniformly distributed across their range  then there is no real opportunity for compression.      otherwise  there is  potential  for compression.  if you can reduce the size of the common numbers then you can typically achieve a saving by compression.  this is how huffman encoding works.    but the downside is that compression at this level is not perfect across the range of numbers.  it reduces the size of some numbers  but it inevitably increases the size of others.       so what does this mean for your use-case?    i think it means that you are looking at the problem the wrong way.  you should not be aiming for a minimal encoded size for every number.  you should be aiming to minimize the size on average ... averaged over the actual distribution of your numbers.  
 to extend on stephen c's answer  here is a piece of code to convert to base 62 (but you can increase this by adding more characters to the   string (just pick what characters are valid for you):         this will never result in the string representation being longer than the digit one.  
 a debugger would help you troubleshoot the situation: tomcat / dbcp connection pools do not return a raw connection but a wrapper/adapter that recycle underlying \"true\" connections. the pool usually checks the connections by itself (reconnect if needed) and  i guess  does not allow to really validate.    you have more info about the pool validation parameters in the  tomcat doc .  another exchange  deals about jboss pools wrapping oracle connections  what is a common practice.    
 you can do this by creating a read privilege which uses the \"all but sources (maven2)\" repository target.  this target uses the following regular expression:         if your source jars do not use the standard maven \"sources\" classifier create a new target using a regular expression that matches your source jars.  
 when you get such a dialog  one of two things might have happened: either there was a javascript error that happened on the browser  or there was an error the server. when the former happens  the dialog includes some more information about the error  which doesn't seem to be showing here. so you're most likely in the latter case: an error happened on the server.    to see what it is  you need to look at the  . it is in   relative to the directory where you start tomcat  which if you start it in   will point to tomcat's   directory. check the   just after you get such an error  and see if you can find an exception at the bottom of the file.    (if looking at the log file doesn't help  feel free to post it somewhere  e.g. on  https://gist.github.com/   update your question to include a link to the file  and post a comment here  so i'm notified do you did so.)  
 haven't tested  but it's most likely due to the fact that you are printing the   object  which will print the  . if you want the raw json  then use  . when you use    then the raw json is converted to a   object.  
 having a combination of   and   in one step is not that useful in java given its type system. e.g. there is no such   type.    the closest thing is  :         but the expressiveness of         is not that bigger compared to         of course  you may create a helper method encapsulating these steps in a single  undissolvable operation:         then you can use it like       
 i am trying to provide the answer of your question as i read somewhere -          r - the type of the result a - the intermediate accumulation type of the collector collector - the collector describing the reduction returns - the result of the reduction    performs a mutable reduction operation on the elements of this stream using a collector. a collector encapsulates the functions used as arguments to collect(supplier  biconsumer  biconsumer)  allowing for reuse of collection strategies and composition of collect operations such as multiple-level grouping or partitioning.  if the stream is parallel  and the collector is concurrent  and either the stream is unordered or the collector is unordered  then a concurrent reduction will be performed (see collector for details on concurrent reduction.)     this is a terminal operation.     when executed in parallel  multiple intermediate results may be instantiated  populated  and merged so as to maintain isolation of mutable data structures. therefore  even when executed in parallel with non-thread-safe data structures (such as arraylist)  no additional synchronization is needed for a parallel reduction.    the following will accumulate strings into an arraylist:          the following will classify person objects by state and city  cascading two collectors together:        
 as far as i can tell from the   interface and some of the supporting libraries  there isn't a  single  operation that does both of these and produces an output   (based on my short reading of the scala   method).     you would need to apply both functions to a   to get the desired output   which can then be collected or any other functions you want to apply to it.        
 as i understand the scala documentation    filters based on whether the function is present  and applies the function to each qualifying object.  a java class has a fixed definition  so such a test wouldn't make much sense.  the closest analog would be testing for an interface and invoking its method (the function) in multiple steps:       
 here's the line of code in question:         you're calling the static method   on an instance of a string object ( ). you should call it on the class itself instead.       
 one way for you to get the output you are seeing is to have      and   all extend class  . in this case  when   is an instance of class    the following two if-s will both return true:   and  .    a simple way to fix this is to change the last 3  -s to  -s  or to put   in each of the if blocks.  
 the issue here is that your classes extend  . remember  extends pretty much means \"is a\". for example:   means a dog \"is a\" animal.    given that  it will always execute the first   statement and then the proper one below it. to resolve this  make the whole thing one big   statement and place the if for   as the last statement. so like this...       
 the parameter in the   constructor you're using - namely   - is for flags  such as    not color values. change your instantiation and initialization as follows:

(please provide code)    first points :  as scary wombat say  if you want to send data to c don't use encoding  juste send bytes.    supposition 1 : encoding is not the same     when you are encoding your bytes to string  you will use the default encoding. as the javadoc says :        constructs a new {@code string} by decoding the specified array of   bytes using the platform's default charset        public string(byte bytes[])      if you need to send string to char*  define the encoding to the both sides :          if your java and c part use different encoding you will get difference in result.    supposition 2 : null byte added if the size is different (1 byte)  it's probably the null byte at end of your char*.    supposition 3 : you read some char who are out of your array    how did you do the init of your char* ? did you any malloc ? a fixed size buffer ? maybe this is wrong and you read another data  owned by another buffer/variable/....    supposition 3' :  miss init the char*  you just read initial buffer value.    don't forget to allocated memory for your struct :  two example to how to allocated struct memory and when

 you should use  . java has strict rules about type inheritance in generics and the code   is not valid.     if it were valid then you could have something like    where   extends/implements   but not  . that would obviously result in an error since   would not fit in a list that requires  .  
 if you want   to return a    the easiest way is to create a   in the method in the first place:          the fact that   will end up consisting only of   instances is irrelevant.    if this is not possible for some reason (for example if the method involves fetching a   from somewhere else)  you can convert a   to a   by writing          however you're better off only ever using   and   in your code  and avoiding   and  . this adheres to the general good practice that you should refer to interfaces rather than concrete types whenever possible.    (or you can use wildcards  as others have suggested.)

 read up on  streams   they're all the new rage.    pay especially close attention to the bit about parallelism:          so to recap  there are no parallel for-loops  they're inherently serial. streams however can do the job. take a look at the following code:       
 when a z3exception with the \"out of memory\" message is thrown  it means that the native libz3.dll ran out of memory. disposing both solver and context in every loop iteration is really the best that can be done (a few things still stay in memory  e.g.  symbols). note however that the solver and context objects look like tiny objects to the garbage collector (they are just a pointer and java can't see what's behind the pointer). so  the first thing to try is to add a call to   in the hope that all z3 objects will actually get collected at that point. also  i seem to recall that the java virtual machine has a default memory limit that is smaller than one would expect  but they can be set by the   and   options.  
 yes  as long as you are using standard java*  then where a class is deployed (jar file  loose class) does not matter.  what does matter is that you launch your application with all relevant class directories and jar files on the class path.    assuming you are in the root directory of the project (janibot)  the following java command will accomplish this:         (* osgi would be an exception to this.  osgi uses a different class loader with a different set of rules  but i assume that is is not in the picture here)  
 anonymous inner classes have access to local variables through a trick behind the scenes.  local variable are implemented as hidden member variables of the inner class.  they are assigned copies of the local variable.  to prevent the copy value from being wrong  the java compiler enforces that these local variables must be   so they aren't changed  so the copy stays correct.    the fields of the enclosing class don't need to be  ; the local variables used must be  .  you must make all local variables used in your anonymous inner class  .  you can do this by declaring   variables to be initialized to your   and   values  and use them in your anonymous inner class.         note that in java 8  this would not be necessary  because the java 8 compiler can detect if the local variables used in anonymous inner classes are \"effectively final\"  that is  not   but never changed once initialized.  
 what is happening is that you are creating 81 actionlistener classes  each one with its own   method. but when that method is executed  the class doesn't know what the value of   and   is anymore  since it left them far behind.    java prevents this from happening  hence the compiler error. it requires any referenced local variables to be final so that it can pass them to the created classes.    the simplest way to solve this is to create a pair of   variables inside your loops:       
 you would need to break the string into length of preference.max_value_length.  i would suggest that you create myvalue.1  myvalue.2  etc... that are related to myvalue. when loaded you just string the values together.    here is some code:         there is also a limit on the key size which is preference.max_key_length.    one more point to make is that you can then use the preference keys method to recreate your object.

 from their   documentation page   (emphasis is mine)     jwpl is for you:       if you need structured access to wikipedia in java.       jwpl is not for you:       if you need to query live data. jwpl works on an optimized database  i.e. you are querying  a static wikipedia dump . this gives much better performance and lightens the load on the wikipedia servers.      so the db settings are to be provided by you.    this means you have to install your own database server  insert all the dumped data given by wikipedia and query your own database.    you would have to update your database regularly if you need 'fresh' results.    if you need up-to-date (i.e. live) results  you would have to use a different tool.  
 jwpl doesn't provide you access to wikipedia  it provides an api to the wikipedia database. you need to download a dump of the database  as detailed  here .    you will also need to be running some form of an sql database that can handle a 4gb+ myisam tables  if you are planning on using an english dump. details on that can be found  here .  
 criteriabuilder also provides   ( javadoc here ) which could take the   as the first parameter  and then your string   as the second argument.    this means what you have will almost work  with only slight modification:       
 i'm assuming you didn't write this code and are trying to understand what it's purpose is. the inner loop should continue until a divisor is found. so it repeatedly checks to see if   evaluates to  . in other words  \"has a divisor  not  been found yet?\".    once a divisor is found    is set to   and the expression   evaluates to    so the loop will stop.    if the condition check that you suggested was used:          the loop body would never be reached.   is   to start with so the continue condition would immediately fail and the loop would terminate.  
 the second loop is saying to continue looping when   is less than   and no divisor has been found. when   has been set to true  then the inner loop will fail its condition.    i think you must have misread the code as this is a pretty straight forward boolean condition.

 instead of         you want something like         you may wish to make the comparison with  contains  case insensitive by using  tolowercase . for this  you will need to change your entries in the list to         and then use         i don't think you need the  for  loop at all.  
 what's currently happening is it's entering the   loop  checking the first user  getting false for   so it doesn't enter the if  enters the else  and then sets   to    so it exits the   loop. so setting   to false should happen after all users have been checked.    as well as that  asking the user for a name should also happen outside the   loop or else it will ask for a new name every time it loops through to check the next user in your  .    keeping that in mind  you could rewrite this section of code:         to this:         i've removed the    instead opting to set   to   only after each element in   has been checked and the   loop has been exited  and also asked the user for a name to search for before the   loop so it asks only once before it searches them all.

 what about skipping lines when parsing the double is not possible? like this:        
 change the signature of your existing method to:         and use   inside of your read loop to control how many lines are skipped. i'd recommend creating a default method that returns all lines:         alternatively this could be a boolean if you know that you'll either want to skip the first line or none at all.    as for the second part of your question  many of those strings will not be parseable. you may want to read  this . but i'm not sure how you expect to parse or use a value like 'yhr051w' (since you said you wanted the first column).  
 the distinction between checked exceptions (i.e. exception and it's subclasses) and unchecked exceptions (i.e. error  runtimeexception  and their subclasses) is not where they can occur  but where they are handled. checked exceptions are called so because they  must  be handled at compile-time - it is a compile-time error to not catch a checked exception at some point*.    runtimeexceptions are ones that do  not  have to be handled at compile-time (or rather  ones that are handled at runtime  by the java virtual machine). as for specifically why they're not called uncheckedexceptions  it may be so there is adequate distinction between error and runtimeexception  or maybe it's just because runtimeexception is what they chose to call it.     relevant part of the jls .    *technically you could just make your methods throw the exception up to and including    but that just means the part of the jvm that invokes   will catch it.  
 the terminology isn't really the issue here  it has to do with the specific way these errors/exceptions occur  and how they are recovered from.    from the  jls section 11.2 :        of the unchecked exception classes  error classes are exempted because they can occur at many points in the program and recovery from them is difficult or impossible. a program declaring such exceptions would be cluttered  pointlessly. sophisticated programs may yet wish to catch and attempt to recover from some of these conditions.        of the unchecked exception classes  run-time exception classes are exempted because  in the judgment of the designers of the java programming language  having to declare such exceptions would not aid significantly in establishing the correctness of programs. many of the operations and constructs of the java programming language can result in exceptions at run time. the information available to a java compiler  and the level of analysis a compiler performs  are usually not sufficient to establish that such run-time exceptions cannot occur  even though this may be obvious to the programmer. requiring such exception classes to be declared would simply be an irritation to programmers.        for example  certain code might implement a circular data structure that  by construction  can never involve null references; the programmer can then be certain that a nullpointerexception cannot occur  but it would be difficult for a java compiler to prove it. the theorem-proving technology that is needed to establish such global properties of data structures is beyond the scope of this specification.       this provides such explanation as to why certain exceptions are termed \"runtime\" and some are not. checked exceptions can be enforced by the compiler  which requires the programmer completely eliminate or otherwise prevent unwanted execution.  
 it is called   probably because one check in the compile phase and prevent it  e.g.   can be prevented by checking for   first.  the other exceptions cannot be checked in the compile phase. anyway  it is just a term.  
 the method   return its value in px. but you have the margin in dp.       
 the   method of   lets you specify the  scale  of the result  which loosely speaking is number of decimal places.    means that a number will be expressed with 3 decimal places.  a negative scale indicates the number of insignificant zeroes at the end of a whole number - so for example to round to the nearest 1000  you can specify  .           but a   is different.  it lets you specify  precision  - that is  the number of significant digits.  this is different from  scale .       
 when you change a label's scale  its new size is not automatically called until   is called. this is to avoid wasting a lot of computation recalculating the size of everything if you make multiple changes that will affect size.    but you can force it to update its size by calling   on the label. then you'll get the proper value when you call  . for example:         in general  this is not wasteful  because it will internally mark its layout as updated  so in most cases it won't have to recalculate this stuff in  .  
 the  documentation for    says:          - the file to use as the destination of this writer. if the file   exists then it will be truncated to zero size; otherwise  a new file   will be created. the output will be written to the file and is   buffered.      so every time you use    you are actually truncating the file  erasing everything in it  and starting fresh.    this means  of course  that as soon as you start logging  the header data gets erased.    if you want to  append  to the file  rather than erase it every time  you need to open a   with the   option  and open the   on top of it.         (note the use of try-with-resources to auto-close the file when work with it is done. of course  you can just keep it opened until you finish logging. this is merely an example.).  
 so the java type of   is      you can do something like that:

 first of all  the chunk of your   is totally irrelevant to the problem ;) the dependencies part would be more interesting.    create or make sure it exist empty file called   in the   directory.    make sure you have the cdi-api dependency defined in your  :         also make sure you are deploying your war into cdi enabled application server like wildfly (jboss) or make sure you have all necessary libraries on the classpath if it is mere servlet container like tomcat.    it is also good practice to inject concrete implementations to interfaces  so your   class should implement some interface specifying its behavior. this is not necessary though.    edit: the dependency to weld is necessary only in se environment. in ee all is needed should be  .  
 i found out how to solve this issue. i added          to pom.xml and created updaterrequestlistener          i wonder if i could do that without some additional weld dependency? is there a javax alternative?  
 it is possible that even though all the methods had a default implementations  these implementations weren't actually  meaningful  in the context of the application. the methods might only do internal bookkeeping while the actually useful implementation must be provided by a derived class which does what it needs to do and then calls the superclass method.    however  this is just speculation. you would have to show an actual example to tell what could be the reason for this design.    as an example  let's take a simple game engine. i have lot's of different  s in my game.        some are visible  so my basic class gets a   method. but there might be invisible objects like trigger areas which don't show up at all  so i implement it as a no-op in the base class.     some do something when they collide with something  so each one gets a   method. but some don't do anything when they collide like a purely visual particle effect  so i also provide a no-op in the base class.     some do something every game tick  so they get a   method. but some objects  like a wall  might not do anything at all on their own. so i also provide a no-op for this.       so what do i do when i have an object which is invisible  doesn't do anything on its own and doesn't interact with anything? there is no reason to have this in the game. so i make this basic class  .  theoretically  you could instance it because all methods have an implementation  but  practically  you have no reason to ever do this  and when you try  you misunderstood how my game engine works.  
 one typical use case is the creation of an  adapter class . think of a callback interface where you could be notified of 10 different events but are normally only interested in some of them. with an adapter class  you can provide empty implementations such that an actual callback only needs to implement those methods that are of interest after extending the adapter. by making the adapter abstract  you express the fact that it makes no sense to instantiate the adapter itself as it does nothing useful.    since java 8  you would not longer implement such an adapter but use  default methods  for the interface.  
 yes  there is. sometimes you know you're creating an abstract class - one that will have to be derived from to make any actual sense  but you want to provide a default implementation to all the methods. this doesn't happen a lot  but it does happen.    update: i just had a case like this. i'm recording various user generated events. each event has a timespan and a description  and they all have other things as well. i've created a base event class:         granted  this is c# and not java  but had i written this in java  i would have done exactly the same thing)  
 you can have an abstract class that implements several interfaces. you need not implement these methods in an abstract class  but you do need to implement them in a subclass of your abstract class.    e.g.       
 if a java class is declared abstract yet has all of its methods declared  then they are doing it so it cannot be instantiated  though it may be subclassed.    \"abstract classes cannot be instantiated  but they can be subclassed.\" see here:  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/iandi/abstract.html   
 you might have some classes that don't make sense in the context of your application but they do in the design.  a silly example: abstract class animal  implement born and die. you don't want an \"animal\". you want a dog. this way you don't have to repeat the code each class you add. now you can have dog  cat or whatever you want  this would be a good reason  anyway it's hard to find.  
 i see this question is already marked answered  but i'd like to provide another alternative explanation.    another reason for this kind of code would be to provide a base implementation for all derived classes of that abstract class.     then when implementing new derived classes you have a runable implementation that you can then choose to override the methods of in order to customize behavior for that derived instance.    take the case of an   which is abstract and provides data access logic based on a common argument  such as itemnumber.     (sorry for the c# code but this question is pretty much just programming theory more than it's about a specific language)         you could then derive a   which uses the base implementation. this accounts for 80% of the items that you are tracking.         then you derive a   that goes to a couple of different data services to acquire information about that particular item type  but still uses some of the base implementation defaults. this covers the next 10%.         then you derive a `specialtype2itembuilder' that goes to yet another set of sporadic dataservices to complete a picture of that item. this one goes overrides another set of methods that are different from type2itembuilder. this covers your last 10%.       
 here is the regex you'll need for your problem :           a link for  explanation  of this regex    here follows the java method to get the arrays of numbers :            test code :             output :           
 i know you asked for a regex but i'm not sure it's the only or the best way to go for such a simple parsing.    here a quick (and not so safe) code:         output:        \"23 22 17\"    \"17 2\"    \"23\"    \"3 29\"    \"\"    \"10 43 6\"    \"7\"    \"32 17 6\"    \"\"    \"\"    \"23 49 12\"    \"14 40 15\"    \"34 41 32\"    \"4 7 19\"    \"9 27\"    \"17\"    \"31 36 45\"    \"\"    \"32\"    \"40 27 25\"      the thing is: you have to make sure that the string provided as an input is always well formatted (beginning with a [  ending with a ]  and made of segments beginning with [ and ending with ]). yet it's almost the same story with regular expressions (invalid input = no outputs  or  partial  outputs).    once you have your strings with numbers separated by commas  the rest of the job is easy (you can split again and then parse to integers).  
      this is my function  mainly i obtained a json with mails from this url. i create a new mail with the fields from that url. but one of field from mails class is mail_contacts where you should save the adresses from each contact like a vector [1 2 3] this is the id from  the adress.    so how can i get the numbers into [ ]  and save it into the fields mail_contacts what its a array.    i can save it like this:        
 what about this:

 typically  you would process user events on a button via the button's    what you want to try and do is stop the user from trigger the buttons    the easiest way that you can do this is disable the button...    normally  i don't like using  s on buttons as this is not normally the best way to ascertain user interaction  but in this case  it's the requirement

 this is different than for instance         here the   on the right hand side is effectively creating the arraylist.    in your example the   is creating a completely different type  namely   and only in the end an   is created by the   method. the compiler can't know that the builder&lt;> has anything do to with your immutablesortedmap.     or with a silly example  this could be perfectly valid:       
 as jeffrey pointed out  java's type inference has some quirks.  the diamond syntax can be used in place of the full type syntax only when you are calling a constructor of the object type that you are assigning the variable to.    the reason you can't use the diamond syntax the way you were trying to is because you were using it with the constructor of a  builder object  instead of the  actual final object  that you are assigning the variable to.    so in other words  this works:         and this doesn't:         java's diamond syntax and generic inference isn't robust enough to figure out what you are doing with the builder  probably because such robustness would be tricky to implement  as java's generic inference would somehow have to know that your \"build\" method is tied to your builder's generic parameters.  
 of course the answer is :         sorry  i got confused.  
 loading of ads might be throwing any un-handled exception. try surrounding the ads-loading code in try-catch. or paste the code in here.    edit: if you are loading ads in the asynctask  remove it from there. call the loading of ad after loading the contacts list.    like:       
 i can confirm that adding the following code in my initial activity solves the problem:       
 you're using the \"load\" method of fxmlloader which returns the root node of your .fxml file. in that case  it's returning your pane.    you should use it to create your scene!    see the example given in the javafx tutorial  like:         other way  taken from one of my old code  using non-static fxmlloader:       
 now i'm trying add in jboss-web.xml         but i have error information          
 this is certainly an ugly stacktrace  which can and should be improved. (i'm about to check in a fix for that.) but the reason that this doesn't work is that a documentprocessor acts like a reader: it only lets you make a single pass through the sentences of a document. so after the first for-loop  the document is exhausted  and the underlying reader has been closed. hence the second for-loop fails  and here crashes out deep in the lexer. i'm going to change it so that it just will give you nothing.  but to get what you want you either want to (most efficient) get both the unigrams and bigrams in one for-loop pass through the document or to create a second documentpreprocessor for the second pass.  
 i think   is causing it.    change your code so you can first check if   and then do   .  
          in this case   \"hello world!\"  is a   string literala series of characters in your code that is enclosed in   double quotes. whenever it encounters a string literal in your code    the compiler creates a   object with its valuein this case     hello world! .           in total you created 3 objecs.  
 the answer seems to be that you need to clean the project when you perform changes to the fx parts. clean before you run it and it will work fine  provided there actually isn't anything wrong with your code.  
 it looks like you want to avoid repeatedly initiating a long running background task. instead of a    use the parent    and set it's name and action to  cancel  when the background task is started. a   such as     makes this convenient. a related example using   is seen  here .  
 use swingworker  try this code:         swingworker is executed on separate worker thread which is invoked by event dispatcher thread by calling execute method. swingutilities.invokelater method just imposes run method to be executed asynchronously on the event dispatching thread  so calling thread.sleep inside it will freezes the event dispatch thread which affects the gui.  
 this is a dependency issue. try without ehcache depency to see if it works. if not  try version \"2.8.3\" of ehcache which should be the one spring 4 wants.  
 there is no mystery. there are going to be at least two versions of java installed on your computer: the one you installed manually  and the one windows uses (most likely inside the \\system32 folder).    when you type the  java  command at the command prompt  the operating system (windows) resolves this command by: 1) executing the command located on the current directory  2) finding the command in one of the paths declared in the path.    i have multiple java versions installed on my computer. the one i want to use to develop software is the one i made sure is declared  first  on my path variable.  
 i solved  status object have his own user object. user object have a method called getprofileimageurl();    so i... :          now it works 100%  
 there is a particular difference between caching solutions like guava and ehcache and what you are trying to implement. the sole purpose of these caches is to act in the same way than getter functions work. so  caches are intended to retrieve a single element by its key and store it for further use; evicting it after it stops being used.     e.g.         that's why getting a whole set of objects from the cache feels a little like forcing the cache and the eviction policy to work differently from its original purpose.    what you need  instead of guava cache (or other caching solutions)  is a collection that can be evicted all at once by a timer function. sadly  guava doesn't provide that right now. you would still need a timer function provided by the application that would remove all existing elements from the cache.      so  my suggestion would be the following:    even when it is possible for guava to behave in the way you want it to  you will find out that you are not using the features that make guava really valuable  and you are \"forcing\" it to behave differently. so i suggest you forget about the guava implementation and consider using  for example  an specialization from the abstractmap class  along with a timer function that will evict its contents every n seconds.    this way you will be able to have all your entries in a single cache and stop worrying about the discrepancies between the timestamp and the time the entry was added to the cache.  
 have you considered using something like a   instead? just put the metrics in the queue and when you want to retrieve metrics for the last n minutes  just start at the end with the most recent additions and take everything until you find one that's from > n minutes ago. you can evict entries that are too old from the other end in a similar way. (it's not clear to me from your question how the key/value aspect of   relates to your problem.)  
 regarding topic 1:    just a sidenote: please do not confuse expiry and eviction. expiry means the entry may not returned by the cache any more and may happen at a specified point in time or after a duration. eviction is the action to free resources  the entry is removed from the cache. after expiry  eviction may happen at the same time or later.    all common cache products do not have support for exact  aka \"point in time\"  expiry. we need that usecase very often in our applications so i spent some effort with  cache2k  to support this.    here is a blueprint for cache2k:         if you have a time reference in the metrics objects  you can use that and you can omit the additional entry class.   instructs cache2k for exact expiry. if you leave this out  the expiry may be a few milliseconds off  but the access time is slightly faster.    regarding topic 2:    the straight forward approach would be to use the interval minutes as cache key.     here is a cache source (aka cache loader) that strictly returns the metrics of the previous interval:         that would return the metrics for 10:00-10:05 if you do the request on lets say 10:07.    if you just want to calculate instantly the metrics of the past interval  then it is simpler:         the use of the cache source has an advantage over  . cache2k is blocking  so if multiple requests come in for one metric  only one metric calculation is started.    if you don't need exact expiry to the millisecond  you can use other caches  too. the thing you need to do is to store the time it takes to calculate the metrics within your cache value and then correct the expiry duration accordingly.    have a good one!  
 you need your own   implementation and check for nulls and return 0       
 using java 8  you can easily build the comparator you need:         use   instead if that's what you want  of course.  
 you have to create a    rather than use a  .         then call sort via:       
 you probably shouldn't use an exception that will always be handled that way  but it  does  seem like the easiest solution.    the best solution for programming practice would be to use event listeners and have the listener/handler call a method to dispose and recreate the dialog box.  
  'question is how do i notify \"main\" that something happened in \"servereditordialogbox\"  and the program needs to restart\"   ==> since \"server_editor_dialog_box\" and \"main\" would be executing in separate thread you need some sort of global messaging service because both threads have separate stack for execution. you could use a queue (java collection) and  declare it as static  .  servereditordialogbox could post the events to the queue and \"main\" can poll the queue and take action accordingly for events that it is intrusted in.  hope this helps  
 i would personally go with an event bus that would allow me to propagate events to various controllers in a transparent way. i have used and i can recommend  guava's eventbus . this allows you to structure your code better and decouple from the ui semantics that traditional java listeners have.     the idea is that you subscribe a method in your main class to a given event and you post it on the bus in your ui code (server_editor_dialog_box).    
 you must create an instance of  . according to  this  page  you can do it by calling:         and then you can get the state by:       
 you can use  androidviewclient  instead (version  8.26.0  or higher)  then you would be able to access basic wifi information.    a basic script to check wifi state would be along these lines       
 from the  specification         a nested   type is implicitly static. it is permitted for the   declaration of a nested enum type to redundantly specify the static   modifier.      regardless  a type is not a member of an instance. it is (possibly) a member of a type.     as the specification says  a  field access expression  takes the following form         fieldaccess :                                      we care about the first case  with a   expression. you have to access the   constant through its type name  through the name of its enclosing type.    you say         i could just use class1.enumexample  but i'm trying to avoid using the class' name in here for convenience and type-safety        there's not much more type safe than using the type name in source code.       a   instance and a type name are two completely different things. the type   is a type like any other (         etc.). it has its fields and methods. if you have a value of type    you can use it to access those members. with a type name  you can declare variables  you can declare type arguments  create new instances (with  )  and invoke   methods.  
 you can do something similar when looking for a   in a    by using the    method  to search the string.       
 you could make a collection of chars that you want to check  and see if the collection contains the char in question. a hashset is ideal here for o(1) look up time. (not that it matters  because the size is constant.)       
 from the performance standpoint the optimum approach would be this:         memory required for the approach is very modest even if you use the whole 16-bit range afforded by the   type: at most 8 kb.  
 back before we had unicode  when the character set was only 128 characters (ascii) or later 256 (iso 8859-1)  we would often just create an array of booleans and use a lookup on the character code--very fast.  you could still do the same (an array of 65536  s isn't all that big by today's memory standards)  or something like         and then to look up:         i think that's still the approach i'd take if efficiency were extremely important.  usually it isn't  so one of the other answers probably gives you more readable code.  
 as described on the following web page  key pairs can only exist in a java key store together with at least one certificate. that is why keystore explorer (and keytool as well) always generate a self-signed certificate for a new key pair:     http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/keystore.html     when you have created the new key pair  simply right-click on the entry and select \"generate csr\".    after the ca has signed a certificate from the csr  right-click on the key pair again and select \"import ca reply\". the self-signed certificate is then replaced by the one from the ca.    and the kse user forum would have been the right place to ask these questions. you have to create an account at sourceforge in order to create new topics there.  
 thread interruption in java is cooperative.    but i believe you understand that. if your affine transform takes that long to run and you try and run it in one go without even checking for the interrupted flag  your transform will happily transform along.    there is no  .    you have no choice. note that i don't know whether it is possible but ideally such a long running thread should be spliced into manageable timeable chunks and the interrupt flag checked between these chunks.    of course  you also have the option to  not  run that transform in the current thread but in an   instead  and grab a   of the result; and you would   with timeout.    but the end problem will remain: you must check for the interrupt flag. and you will have to deal with a   on  .       ok  i suck at math. but can't this transform be split in several threads? can't you use  for instance  the fork/join framework? or better yet  if you use java 8  a   and a  ?  
 no  i would not define a single class to do all the injections.  all your classes are coupled that way.    i don't understand what \"define the injections manually\" means.  you have to specify them in either xml or annotations.  there's no other way that i know of.    you don't say if you're using xml or annotation configuration.  i find myself using the latter more of the time  with only enough xml configuration to tell the spring app context to scan for annotations.    the spring idiom would have you specify your configuration in layers if you're using xml.  it's a moot point for annotations  because they go into your source code.    your application will read the spring context on start up  instantiate all the beans  and wire together the necessary dependencies.  you're good to go from then on.      i disagree with the link you provided.    avoid autowiring?  no.  
 the article said that he recommends using xml configuration for large projects. this is a very small project at this point. it seems to me that auto wiring with annotations would be fine even by the article's author's words.  
 it should be possible to implement this via redis sorted sets and lua scripts. sorted sets are set of elements ordered by a score  but the score can be updated dynamically. one way to update the score of a sorted set  is to increment its scopre via zincrby  this corresponds to what you are trying to do afaik. the element will be automatically moved in the right place according to the incremented score. then by using the other sorted sets commands you can simulate popping from the sorted set by consuming the element  if this is the semantics you want.  
 if it can't be null  but you don't know what to return instead  either:    have the concrete implementation specify what its default should be:         or make the caller specify it:       
   yes    yes.       focus on self containment and maintain areas of responsibility. it is the responsibility of each ui screen to manage it's content  no one else  in fact  you should guard against allowing unrestricted modification to these components and provide access only through managed methods indirectly (setters and getters)  which allow the modification of the properties you want to be changed  and not simply providing the component via a getter  this prevents problems with people removing components you don't want removed  for example.    you could also use interfaces to maintain common functionality if required  so if the   really only wants to deal with a certain amount of the information/functionality  you can use an interface that all the other screens use which will simplify the process  as the   only needs to know about the class that implement the interface and not every thing else that might be going on...as a suggestion..        also  where should i put the code for switching between screens?      from my perspective  it's the responsibility of the   game to determine when and to which screen should be shown.  what i would normally do  is provide some kind of notification process that the current screen can ask the   to switch screens  maybe via a listener or other agreeded interface.  this would mean that each screen would need reference to  .    instead of passing it ( ) directly  i'd create an interface that   would implement (say  )  which defined the calls/contract that each sub screen could use ( / ) for example.    take a look at  model-view-controller  for more ideas

 while writing the third bullet for my question  i realized that   was actually a new file that didn't previously exist  and i hadn't actually checked what was in it. i just opened it up and lo and behold  it's exactly the class loading logs that i was looking for.    so to recap  here are the answers to my bullets:      you can have a file with nothing but     you save it to     the output is in      
 thread preemption doesn't cause the preempted thread to release its locks. if it did  locks would be worthless. the whole point of a   block is that it will disallow other threads from synchronizing on the same object until the thread releases the lock (by leaving the   block).  
 i'm pretty sure it's not possible for a second thread to enter the   block before the first one has executed the entire block. on obtaining the lock on the object  all other threads attempting to enter the synchronized code will be blocked.    see more information here:  http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/synchronized.html   
 even if a thread is preempted  it won't release a lock.  the lock is still held.  if another thread comes along  it will block (stop running) until the lock is released  even if the original thread gets preempted several times before it releases the lock.  basically almost any kind of lock has some storage in the heap that gets written to indicate there's a lock.  it's permanent until the thread or the system write a different value to indicate the lock is free.    it is of course possible to write code that allows access to an instance or field without ever taking the lock  but that's a coding error.  it's also possible for the original thread to exit the block early (say it throws an exception) -- this releases the lock  and other threads can continue as normal.  
 basically you can use  locks  objects. lock objects can allow you to sequentially apply and release locks on multiple locks line by line.     a very good tutorial on how to implement it  here     check out below code:          output        
 you should remove the   folder from your classpath  and set the   as your source folder    as your test source:       
 get a timestamp in onresume  get a new timestamp in onpause and save the difference. both those methods are guaranteed to be called as part of the activity lifecycle. you could use user preferences to store the value or pass it around to your new activities if the scope of your main activity being in the foreground isn't sufficient.  
 i also think it is better to do this with timestamps  not running the thread and using system resources  such as memory  cpu... using timestamps on start/ finish of your application should be more efficient.  
 use a shared preference and store a start time when the application is started.    system.currenttimemillis() // current time in milliseconds.    on start         then at any point you can pull up this value and calculate time played.         timeruninmillis will be how long your application has been running in milliseconds.  
 please upgrade to newest version of hazelcast; 3.3.x. in 3.1/3.2 there were some issues that could lead to a memory leakage; perhaps you are running into one of these issues.    i don't know what is consuming your memory. i normally take a heapdump and analyse it. but first try upgrading.

 the  sessionstorage  object stores the data for one session in browser window/tab  on client side .     there is no way to access the sessionstorage from server with java.    you can though send the data to server and there you can pick it up with java.    you can send it per ajax or you can submit it in hidden fields.     if you store a complex data structure with objects and arrays in sessionstorage then you might convert it to json as an easy to use transport medium.     you would convert the sessionstorage to a json string on client side with         you can parse the json string with java on server side with classes from  com.ibm.commons.util.io.json  package       
 this will get the sessionscope not the localstorage  webstorage  sessionstorage locally in the browser    but if you want sessionscope this is how you do it import these two classes         and then you can get it using this code       
 you have to mock the call to mockedparmlist.getparameterbykey(). otherwise  it's returning null  and then you're calling getvaluestring() on it  which gets you to the npe.         either you can use an actual parameter value (probably)  or you can mock the parameter that you're going to return.  
 the first thing that comes to mind is  if i understand your question  you tell all sprites where is the point which must rotate using:         edit new  edited for your comment    simple test for 1 sprite rotation  maybe is not the best way but it occurred to me that right now.   like this helps you  if your sprite is at 50.50  of the your map  and the center of your map is 400  240  i would create a variable that will store the initial position of the sprite     example:       
 if you use a   to bind a    you don't need the single quotes (which indicate a string literal) around the   - the jdbc driver will take care of the typing for you. just drop them  and you should be fine:       
 the easiest way is probably to do it in java and write a jni callback to call that java function.  if you do need to do it in c  you'll need to use jni to create an intent  then to set the action and extras of the intent  then use jni to call the sendbroadcast method of your activity to actually send it.  its a lot of boilerplate jni code  so i'd try to avoid it.  
 you're attempting the singleton pattern here. i'm not sure why you want to store these objects in a list. the most sensible way to store them is in an object that you guarantee to create one instance of. there are a few ways you could do this. i think in your case the following would work         then  wherever you need your su process  just call         and it will be there like a michael jackson song.  
 i have solved it. i did end up having to echo and check for done  but i have done it without a loop  or sleeping in my thread  so it will fire as soon as it can  without hogging the cpu. the concurrent class i was looking for was   as well.    the assignment look like this:         and   became:         although  this feels slightly sloppy  i may end up posting this on code review.  
 if this is  your  project  you should call  . if you are trying to upload a third party jar  which you need and is not available at maven central  then you can use  . however  you're facing a known issue  see  https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/minstall-110   
 generally speaking  you should use maven binary repositories to move files between systems  not install-file.  check out archiva  artifactory  and nexus.    you should treat the mvn local .m2 directory as a cache  not as something to install files into by hand  otherwise you'll find that you are having to spend a lot of time reverse engineering the repository format.        i am packaging a component into a jar file  and attempting to install   it to another system for development      from a high level  it looks like you are blurring the line local development builds (snapshots) and release builds (files copied to another server).    i'd say you are going to be happier either just checking out source locally and doing builds there  or else releasing artifacts between systems using a binary repo.  
 since   is a primitive type  an array of chars will store those bytes directly in the array with no per-character overhead at all.    by contrast    is an object  so the array will store pointers to   instances elsewhere in the heap  each of which has its own overhead of vtable  length  &amp; other information (including a separate reference to a   with the actual text).  having lots of objects also increases the risk of gc heap fragmentation.    in addition  if you build the strings by concatenation instead of  s  you'll also get lots of extra copies taking up much more memory.  
 you're missing an   which can parse   in the response body and convert it to a  .    spring already provides an   that can parse  . if your response body contains json content that is a json number (which maps to a java  )  it can do the conversion for you. the same cannot be said for  .    you need to implement your own   that performs this parsing and conversion and register it. through java configuration  you can use something like     to register an instance. xml configuration must have something similar.  
 for the general case  i'd say \"it's an interface  so just create a mock.\"  for this case  i think you're testing the wrong seam.      the true unit under test in this case is your anonymously-declared   implementation.  consider that to truly test the whole   method  you would have to verify that all six methods that you've implemented are consistent with their expected behavior.  therefore  you should promote the anonymous implementation to a concrete one and test those methods.  each of them should have at least one test and in those tests you can mock out   to deal with your recursive calls.    
 you almost had it. i just tried:         both of these approaches worked for me.   select data from dropmenu by classname:         or   select data from dropmenu by name         which returned the first item from the drop down menu.    edited  
 you need to have an instance of fullhouse that you can call settab on. in other words  the compiler is asking  which fullhouse do you want to call settab on? you hopefully instantiated it somewhere.    can't give more specifics without more details from your first code block.  
 just declare a local controller and call   once:    for example:       
 in the interface  you could get the controller through a getter:         then  the implementation class also uses the getter:         this way  it's easier to change the decision that it's a singleton later on.    also  if you'll be calling lots of controller methods in succession  you might consider making it a  fluent interface   and renaming the getter simply to   (i think it makes it more fluent as well)  you'd have:         this cuts down on the verbosity even further...    and  if the default implementation you provide in the interface for   is really meant to be overridden every time  you should consider keeping it abstract. the method   would still be available for implementing classes to use.  
 set it to a variable in the target context(s) (class); even in a variable it's the same instance. just a different reference to the same instance.    
 you can have an public enum called  sigletonenum  with a single instance called  instance .  this is a singleton.    as this is an enum  it is not required to be instantiated.and then in the application you can call it as        
 basicially  you need calculate the angel between the start point and end point  something like...         as an example:       rotating a triangle around a point java     java make a directed line and make it move     mouse motion listener only in one direction     java: move image towards mouse position       to track the mouse  use a   and      take a look at:       how to write a mouselistener     how to write a mousemotionlistener     
 try using mouseinfo.getpointerinfo().getposition() (  http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/awt/pointerinfo.html#getlocation%28%29 )  it will return a point object.  use a timer and on every timer event you'll move your bullet a specific length (which you would want it to move) towards the mouse position provided by aforementioned method.  you could do it like reducing difference of x- and y- variables of mouse position and bullet position.   
 use this command to get the mouse location:         if you want to get the distance between them you use simple geometry. look up pythagorus theorum - sidea^2 + sideb^2 = sidec^2 -         you then need to do a calculation to get the angle:         here the opposite is the distance in y and the hypotenuse is the actual distance(as we calculated above) so...          sorry its a bit psuedo code - ish i didn't look up the maths methods for the function calls etc. but hopefully you get an idea of how to do it....  
 the reason is of course that you are just extracting the text from the   element. what you should do is to get the sub-node (or maybe sub-nodes  don't know the exact layout of your files) and output them again using a  . the code would look something like:       
 you need to add your buttons:             
 have you tried to insure that the total number of threads that tomcat and you jobs use totals the number of cores on your system?  i would venture to say that you would probably get closer to the 99% execution for those threads.    the other question that i have is if the tomcat threads have a higher priority than your worker threads.  if that is the case then you should be seeing this difference on a consistent basis.  i do not recall if you can see the thread priority using jconsole or visualvm but maybe increasing the thread priority of the thread pool should provide more cpu cycle but that will affect tomcat ability to handle web requests.  
 because that isn't a block  and you can't declare a variable in parenthesis unless it's a   loop. also  your test should be   or calling   will throw a  .       
 you can't do this because   is already out of scope after you've resolved the conditional statement.  
 i am not totally sure whether i get your question right. however the problem seems identical/similar to the one i answered here:  guava cache  how to block access while doing removal     if not  please add more detail.  
 normally if you want to access some liferay methods which are not exposed as remote api then:      you can create your own plugin   create methods which would use liferay's methods in your plugin  like a wrapper around liferay's methods.   then expose your custom methods as web-service for accessing remotely   this way you can build a web-service client to access liferay's api external to liferay      ofcourse this is assuming you can deploy a plugin to the liferay server.    if you can provide more information as to what you intend to do  may be a usecase then we can provide some other alternative.    hope this helps.  
 if you read the javadocs for thread  it tells you  never ever  use   on thread objects. you should use join()  
 instead of wait()  you can use :         but i dont know the context of your situation.  
 you are looking at the \"lost notification\" problem.  (i.e.  you are not using wait() in the proper way.)    when you call    you should  always  be waiting for some condition that you can explicitly test.  e.g.  like this:         when you do anything that makes the condition true  it should look like this:         when you do anything that makes the condition false  it should look like this:         notice that:       any code that touches the   is synchronized  and always synchronized on the same object.     it is impossible for   to be called when the condition is true.     the   is called in a loop.       point (2) is crucial  because   does not do anything at all if there is no other thread waiting to be notified.  a notification that nobody's waiting for is \"lost\".  the   object does not remember that it was notified.    point (3) is important for two reasons.  the main one is  if thread a calls foo.wait()  and then thread b makes the condition true and calls foo.notify(); there's no guarantee that the condition will  still  be true when the wait() call eventually returns in thread a.  some other thread could have made the condition false again.  this is a very real scenario in many applications.    the other reason why point (3) is important is that the java language specification permits foo.wait() to return even when foo.notify() has not been called.  that's called a \"spurious wakeup\"  and allowing it to happen makes it easier to implement a jvm on certain operating systems.  
 you can do something like        
 looking at your code in github you have 2 methods:         if you ever use the 2nd one  then you are sharing the same instance of coordinates so changing one will change the other    the solution is to copy the values instead       
 in the class   you set the coordinates:          subsequently this code          is equivalent to         because   references the same object as   does. your setter method just sets the reference  but it does not copy the object.  
 the solution is to make   generic:         or  if you want to call the type parameter something different:         there's really nothing error-prone about it.  if you need a method to  say  register a listener  it would look like:         this would ensure that  if you add a listener to an instance of something that implements    then the listener must be something that implements   with the same generic parameter (if you don't use raw types).  
 why bother with the nested interface?  promote that to the top level  and then compose it into the foo class.    bar.java         foo.java       
 there is no such thing as a non-static interface.    for  classes  you can have the desired behavior:         for interfaces  you will need to use         which is essentially the same as:         essentially   interfaces are always     and    classes (and interfaces) do not inherit the parents generics   because it violates the concept of being  ...  
 you may use  simpledateformat  to determine if the string representation is valid.    from your string    2014-05-11t09:00:01.772401    it seems the pattern would be:     example usage:       
 you are looking for the biginteger class  which is an arbitrary-precision integer class.    you can create one with a   argument  like so:         the class contains add()  subtract()   multiply()  divide()  mod() and other mathematical functions.    see the javadocs here:     biginteger   
 yes  use biginteger to store large input.     you can take input as text and then parse it using biginteger.  
 php arrays are not objects  they are assigned by value:         a workaround is to use reference signs   (a bad idea generally) or  s:       
 return reference array using &amp; operator  something like      
 i think the problem is the use of sublists.  specifically          and then later         this changes the size of the sublist vs the size of the original list.    the javadoc of sublist says:        the semantics of the list returned by this method become undefined if the backing list (i.e.  this list) is structurally modified in any way other than via the returned list. (structural modifications are those that change the size of this list  or otherwise perturb it in such a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.)      the sublist instance returned by   throws an exception if the modcounts of the sublist vs the original list differ.    the solution is to make a new list using the elements from the sublist       
 you need to create another list instead of getting a sublist and adding a sublist to it.    try something like this instead:       
 you must use a list iterator if you intend to modify the list while iterating.         if you replace your code with this  it should work.  
 use an executorservice and wait on the future returned.  the code below will submit each task to a thread within the executor service (thread pool) and get back the future for that task.  when all submitted it will wait on the future.  the get method will only return when the   method completes in the task.         however    you can make your code cleaner by removing the blockingqueue entirely and having each task be a   where it simply returns the   variable.  and when you call   the return value there would be the word count.  
 this is what i would do:       create a counter variable (here is how to do it in a way that is safe for  multi-threads ) to keep track of how many threads you are spawning in the main thread    create an interface with function signatures to increment/decrement that counter    implement that interface in your main thread    subclass a worker thread to accept that interface as a parameter    once the worker thread finishes  call that interface to decrement the number of running threads.     in the implementation of the decrement function on the main thread  add a condition to do something once the counter is 0.    
 you need to keep the created threads in a list and join them from the current thread. something like this:         the   method will block until the thread terminates.  
 if you know how many threads to wait on  then you can use a shared  semaphore .  the worker threads each calls   on the semaphore when they're done; the main thread calls   where   is the number of worker threads  which causes the main thread to wait until   permits are available (i.e. until all   worker threads are finished).  
 for authentication  see this example  https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control .    as for the authentication token  you can set it in the query string of the request  like    
 for speed improvements  a   would be faster  also using the same   and  . something like this maybe:       
 plain   is o(n^2). with recurrence it seems to be o(n^3)  
 you're using the raw form of the   interface when you assign the new   to  .  using the raw form of the interface forces type erasure on everything in the interface  meaning that the   returned in the foreach loop returns  s  not  s.    but   takes a type argument that must still be supplied  even if   isn't itself generic.  try       
 because java classes consist of methods and blocks. you can't have a raw statement like         finally  your application needs an  entry point  and the java virtual machine starts by invoking   as documented by  jls-12.1.4. invoke           finally  after completion of the initialization for class   (during which other consequential loading  linking  and initializing may have occurred)  the method   of   is invoked.        the method main must be declared       and  . it must specify a formal parameter ( §8.4.1 ) whose declared type is array of  .    
 you need   because is the convention from where the program starts. the program cannot know what does or why exist a class so it works only when you using it inside the   by convention it's the starting point.  
 could you please post the code of the constructor of your stage?    just a note  from the  doc :        note that showing a modal stage does not necessarily block the caller.   the show() method returns immediately regardless of the modality of   the stage. use the showandwait() method if you need to block the   caller until the modal stage is hidden (closed). the modality must be   initialized  before  the stage is made visible.          edit  - my mistake  i didn't notice the createmodal() method. what i ended up doing in some of my custom stages is:         (java 8  obviously  override run() method if lambda is not available with your current language level (&lt; 8)).    but i only do this for non-modal stage. modal stage should take the focus automatically.     according to the doc of  modality   application_modal is supposed to do what you expect (including blocking the events for other windows):        application_modal defines a modal window that blocks events from being   delivered to any other application window.         you call initmodality with window_modal before calling initowner. please see:        window_modal public static final modality window_modal defines a modal   window that block events from being delivered to its entire owner   window hierarchy. note: a stage with modality set to window_modal  but   its owner is null  is treated as if its modality is set to none.      if requestfocus() (called  after  the modal stage has been displayed  and in the  ui thread  right?) doesn't take the focus  i guess your main window is automatically taking it back.   
 try reading through this article on help.openshift.com about deploying pre-compiled war files and see if that helps ( https://help.openshift.com/hc/en-us/articles/202399740-how-to-deploy-pre-compiled-java-applications-war-and-ear-files-onto-your-openshift-gear-using-the-java-cartridges ).    you are possibly not removing the pom.xml and src directories if it's building a new root.war file.  
   remove pom.xml and src folder from your cloned repo as corey112358 said   then put your war file into webapps folder (direct subfolder of your repo)   do the git: git add --all git commit -m\"another commit\" git push   watch the output for \"found port...\" to make sure your tomcat restarted fine      remember that the war file does not get expanded (unzipped) in openshift.  
 what happens when you have a single character string (\"a\" for example) and you do this?         since wordlength = 1  wordlength-2 = -1 which isn't a valid index into a string.    the same problem would come up if you did this:         or         since wordlength = 0    what you need to do is check your wordlength before you continue:       
 right click the   folder         then type   as the directory name and choose xml as the resource type.         if you do not see the   show up    the project pulldown at the top of the screen like so. e.g. change from android to project         now right click   in the   and choose copy         now right click the   folder and click paste.         you should see this popup         click      at this point you should be good to go.  
 so  if you get a nullpointerexception from a line like this:         you can see that either         or   is null.    then you have to check which one of those is being null  and ensure that it is being initialized.  
 i've fixed the problem by using 'javax.servlet:jstl:1.2' instead of 'org.glassfish.web:javax.servlet.jsp.jstl:1.2.1'.  
 here is your misunderstanding: you said:        the second type parameter of   should support any type that extends        this is not correct. the second type parameter of   is constrained to be a specific subclass of    e.g.   . so you can't pass in an arbitrary   instance  because that's a more generic type.    if you want to have arbitrary subtypes of    just use   as the second type parameter instead of  .  
 since a raw type is the erasure of that type ( 4.8 )  a raw   returns a raw   from  .    the solution is either to remove the generic type parameter from   or to not use a raw type  depending on whether the parameter is actually necessary.  
 as per the last edit. a generics had been added to one of the class definitions - probably by the friendly help of eclipse (and obviously me accepting it without knowing exactly what i did!).    the excellent comments for further info helped find the wrong declaration :-)  
 i think the \"simple\" answer to your question is that you will need shared storage under you kubernetes cluster  so that every pods access the same data. then it wouldn't matter where the pods are running and which pod is actually executing the service.    may be another solution would be  flocker   they describe themself in short:         flocker is a data volume manager and multi-host docker cluster management tool. with it you can control your data using the same tools you use for your stateless applications by harnessing the power of zfs on linux.      anyway i think the storage question on kubernetes or any other dockerized infrastructure is very interesting.     it looks like the google-app-engine doesn't support sharing data store between their apps by default like they pointed out in this  so question   
 if you are running in google compute engine  you can use a compute engine persistent disk (network attached storage) that is bound to the pod  and moves with the pod:     https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/volumes.md#gcepersistentdisk     we'd like to support other types of network attached storage (iscsi  nfs  etc) but we haven't had a chance to build them yet.  pull requests welcome! ;)  
 the standard java priorityqueue does not support update. if you need to remove items  then you have to implement your own minheap. call heapify when you removed some items in the heap.    the implementation and explanation can be found  here !  
   does not have an implementation but   does  they are  .     according to  documentation :    the   method may be overridden to impose a policy for removing stale mappings automatically when new mappings are added to the map.   
 i guess the problem is related to   field which is declared twice in the entity:           try to rename the foreign key  i.e.            edit : also make sure   entity is included in persistence.xml  
 you could make your \"error\" an int instead of a boolean  and have your php backend return specific error codes. this would allow your android application to understand the specific error. without this kind of modification  checking the value of message for a specific string is another option.    for example  you could return 0 if there was no error  1 if the username was already taken  2 if .. etc.  
 i think you want help to get and read the json data provided by your service  right? in your signup activity create an asynctask because you can not perform this on the main thread.         and then call         and you will see the json string printed on your console :)    to get an jsonobject using the response string:         hope that helps.  
 before registering the user and inserting into database  check the query for username in database..and if user name found then encode json value as error    $query=mysql_query(\"select id from yourtable where username ='$username'\"); if(mysql_numnum_rows($query)>0)                  
 there is no automatic way to save the state of a window and all of it's components. you have to do it manually. usually this is done with config files. when the frame closes  you store all of it's components values in a file  and when the frame opens it reads that file and reloads the component's values. take a look at properties  something perfectly fit for that need. here is a good tutorial to start with:  http://www.mkyong.com/java/java-properties-file-examples/   
 it seems you're trying to communicate through http  say  port number 80 over the web. take a look at  how to do http authentication in android?  that covers one that you wanna do.    if you insist on using key/value pairs for appending credentials to each http request using     is more organized to meet your purpose. so once you get these values from the response  store them with:         for retrieving:       
 yii saves information in the $_session variable on the server (and possibly in cookies but i can't recall for sure) but you aren't saving that.  
 a \"nested\" interface (bar in your example) is implicitly static. so it can't access instance specific information related to foo  such as its generic type.    see for example  jls #8.5.1 :        a member interface is implicitly static

 if you had a reference  t  to the thread was running the task  you could call  ; but the standard library executorservice implementations aren't going to tell you what thread is running the task.    you could have the task itself record what thread is running it:         that way  when your main thread times out  it could call

 maven automatically copies all files in the   folder to your build directory.     you should see anything in resources at the root of your classpath in the build directory  if everything worked.     for example  if your build directory is 'bin' then you should see:         change your   call to:         which will indicate that the resource is found at the root of the classpath  not the root of the class used to locate the resource.     you noticed that when you tried this:   which returned  . this is telling you without the   that the \"root\" is the directory where that class is located  not the classpath root.    the key is the leading   which isn't entirely intuitive.  
 here are some generic steps:      figure out what the direct link to the file is  in your example it's  this link  for the war   use some command line tool to download the file      example with  wget :          another possibility would be to  rsync  or  scp  the war from your machine

 if the   is available  (note: still the performance and time complexity will largely depend on the on-disk structures and the underlying file system implementation. ex btrfs  everything is b-tree  ext4 and xfs use h-trees)     therefore for traversing the directory structure until the leaf node (directory which contains the file)  the average case time complexity should be o(logn)  while worst case would be o(n)  n = no of directories in the tree. the worst case is when you have nth directory created under n-1  and n-1th directory created in n-2  and so on ... until the root directory  forming a single branch in the tree. ideally you don't have to traverse through all the directories in the tree from the root if you have the full path.      then if your underlying fs supports directory indexes and hashing  each lookup would require another o(1) in finding the file within the directory. therefore  o(logn) + o(1)  i.e ignoring the lower order terms it should be only o(logn)  where n is the level.  
 some popular filesystems use more efficient data structures than older filesystems.  ext4 has directory hashing turned on by default (as pointed out by @ninjalj)  as does xfs.  this means lookups in a single directory are expected to take   on average (so constant time if your path has a fixed maximum number of subdirectories). this follows the  performance of the hash function itself.     even if you have zillions of files per directory  accessing a single file is very fast -- but only if you have the full path. if you do not have the full path  and instead have to look through a directory for a pattern  you are faced with   on the number of entries in the directory.  that's further exacerbated by a small read size (32k) for the default system-level directory reading calls.    (while   directories can have huge numbers of files  they are limited to 64000 subdirectory entries.)  
 you cannot assume that the uri returned by the media picker will correspond to a local file. it looks like you're selecting a g+ photo or some other image that is not in the device.    the correct way to go would be to use a     to access the picture as a stream. for example:         that should work for both    or   uris.    and (very important) make sure to do this from a background thread (e.g.  )  otherwise you'll get a   if the uri is a \"remote\" one.  
 you have to handle the content://com.google.android.apps.photos.content type of url with a content provider  as you are already. however you should try doing it this way  skipping the real file path and just getting the bitmap itself.     http://stackoverflow.com/a/19835603/4380308   
 fundamentally  you're trying to replace a private field with an alternative implementation  which means you'd violate encapsulation. your only other option is to restructure the class or method  to make it better-designed for testing.    there are a lot of short answers in the comments  so i'm aggregating them here (and adding a couple of my own) as community wiki.  if you have any alternatives  please feel free to add them here.     restructure the class      create a setter for the field in question  or relax the field's visibility.    create a dependency-injecting override or static method that takes a dao  and make the public instance method delegate to it. test the more-flexible method instead.         add a constructor overload or static factory method that replaces private fields for the sake of testing.   fully structure the class for  dependency injection . ( sotirios delimanolis    ejk )      note that some of these can be package-private for testing  if you put your tests in the same java package (possibly in a separate source tree). in all cases  good names and documentation are helpful to make your intentions clear.    violate encapsulation      use reflection to set private fields in the class. ( kinbiko  - see  answer )   use  powermockito  to replace the   constructor with a mock of your choice. ( dave newton )    
 how about this?          edit: as mentioned in the comments this assumes that you don't change the name of the   field. it might be a good idea then to get all the fields    and iterate over them  getting the field(s) of type dao. then proceeding as above. this way your test doesn't depend on the name of your field anymore.  
 i was using a makefile to construct the jar i'm using  and i needed to include the nested classes in the jar       
 looking at hibernate's implementation of  org.hibernate.jpa.graph.internal.attributenodeimpl  lead us to the conclusion that   cannot be:      simple types (java primitives and their wrappers  strings  enums  temporals  ...)   embeddables (annotated with  )   element collections (annotated with  )           i didn't find similar restriction in jpa 2.1 spec  therefore it may be hibernate's shortcoming.       in your particular case the problem is that   refers to the   class which is an embeddable  thus its usage in the entity graph seems to be forbidden by hibernate (unfortunately).    in order to make it work you would need to change your entity model a little. a few examples that come into my mind:      define   as entity   remove   and move its   field into   entity (simplifies the entity  model)    move   field from   into   entity  add map of   map to   entity:            of course the entity graph may require changes accordingly.  
 first  you forgot to close your   there.    as for your grand total  you realize that a grand total is not something that applies to each item. it is the total sum of all the costs of all the items. so first  you are not supposed to display it in every row like you do the items.    second  regarding your method: for the same reason  you cannot calculate a grand total in the class of a single item. you can only calculate a grand total when you can see the entire collection of items. so adding a method like that to   like you have   is not going to work.    you could add it as a method to the servlet  by passing it the collection  looping and summing. but i suggest  since you are already looping  that you simply calculate the grand total while you are already looping.    so add a declaration before your loop:         and inside your loop  add:         at the end of the loop  you'll have a grand total. you'll need to display an extra row  where you'll put the grand total at the end  and only then to close with  .    one last little note about your method: don't declare a variable that's supposed to be used for calculations using a wrapper class like  . use   instead. use wrapper classes only when you put things inside collections or otherwise need an object. using a temporary variable that is a wrapper clase will cause the creation of many auto-box and auto-unbox objects and give the garbage collector a lot of work.  
    
 either use a debugger (like in eclipse) or set some system.out lines to verify  but it seems the arraylist is empty and not entering the while-loop.  
 the first point is the answer you are looking for i hope  but the other parts are also interesting if that is not the case (sorry for not asking in comments).      you are getting the second point with the constant    but probably you have only   and  . arrays are indexed from   in java.   do you catch exceptions? (your comment about changing the order does not affect the outcome suggests not  just want to be sure.) [catching exceptions without at least printing out the stacktrace is very bad habit.]   in case the answer to first question yes... any chance that the edge is    or the    (why do you use raw types?)   (why do you need listiterators?)   can you share the implementation of  ?      so i would use something like this:         @ascalonian's answer is a useful suggestion. with that  you could see the problem when you set a breakpoint to  . after that  you just have to examine the stack to see the problem.  
 to find out who made the last 5 commits in a branch  try server.getchangelists():     http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/p4java-javadoc/com/perforce/p4java/server/iserver.html#getchangelists(int  java.util.list  java.lang.string  java.lang.string  boolean  boolean  boolean  boolean)     specify maxmostrecent=5  and for your filespecs  specify //depot/branch/name/...    since you only want committed changes  specify submittedonly=true.    i think you can disregard the other arguments to getchangelists for your particular use case.    once you have retrieved those changelists  look at the getusername function in the changelistsummary that you get back.  
 you can try:      or  here  is a post of stackoverflow for a custom function.  
 with  java-8   you could use    .         it uses a     behind the scenes  a new class that has been introduced.     otherwise  pre-java 8 and if you don't want a third-party library  a   with a for loop will do the trick.  
 i would convert the list to an array  then use the stringutils.join() method:         you'll need the first and last \"~\" to be added separately  as shown in the last line.    this method doesn't require java 8  in case you haven't upgraded yet.  
 i found in this forum which opencv doesn't works properly with stream in mjpg format. in this forum also  i found a code to use with javacv  and this worked fine for me:         }  
   is the way to go here. try using  .     here  is one post  which might help you with more context on this.  
 the problem is probably the following:         you probably want that to be something like this:         notice that the value of   should be a list of map  not a map.    see  https://github.com/jeffbrown/fundbinding .  that project includes the following:    src/groovy/demo/createfundingcommand.groovy         grails-app/controllers/demo/democontroller.groovy         test/unit/demo/democontrollerspec.groovy         also note that in your code you are calling   inside of you controller action which is not necessary. the instance will already have been validated before your code executes.    i hope that helps.  
 you will need to replace the master fragment with a fragment containing the list you want to display instead.    let's say you have something like this:         so instead of          you will call          where   is a container (e.g.  ) containing your master  .       looking at your screenshot  i think you need to replace   in   with   and then follow the steps i mentioned above.    you will also need to put the original master   in place by adding something like          in   of your  .  
 don't use extends/super as you will not be able to put elements in a map.it will give a compilation error       
   will return object on get(). it is better to use   then put() will accept long and integer and get() will return number  
 try file name as       
 most likely your app is running from a different directory than you expect and your relative path is relative from the executable's directory.  so you can try a few things.      copy your text file into the same directory as the exe and see if that solves the problem   use an absolute path to the file instead of relative.  backslashes need to be escaped \"\\\".  so this would look like:           if either of those solves your problem  then it was just a path issue.  
 if you don't want to specify a hard-coded path  here the idea to get file from your classpath:       
 assuming i understood you correctly  just perform a 3 bit logical shift to the right:         like this:         output:       
 i don't have a solution for you  but just a little tip: your test method should have the minimal possible fixture (read more at  http://xunitpatterns.com/minimal%20fixture.html ). in your case there is a ton of mocking  which is not needed for the given test method (even more - you do not want any interactions at all). it makes it very hard to debug when error occurs.  
 try this mate  your loop parameters were wrong     basically  its a two dimensional array. the first loop checks the outer array length and the second loop checks length of each individual array.       
 put the second dimension into the first loop:       
 the code you included doesn't output what you said it does. its output is:        1    2    4    4      and then it throws an exception:        exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.arrayindexoutofboundsexception: 4      here is what your   and   variables are set to:         so  the outer loop will loop twice  which is what you want.    however  the inner loop will always loop 7 times  since that is what   equals. this results in printing out each of the numbers in the first inner array  1  2  4  and 4  and then when it tries to access the 5th number  the   occurs  since there is no 5th number in the first inner array.    instead  you should have the second loop only loop through the contents of each array  like this:         the output from this is:        1    2    4    4    2    4    5    5    4    3    3                                                                                                                 
 your code throws an   when i=0 and j=4.    this is because your arrays are not the same length as each other.  
 this mostly happens when their is a lot of xml (layout) on the activity and the memory is not sufficient to hold the elements all together. in that case the eclipse hangs and if you run it again all the launching gets queued up  the ultimate solution is to kill all the launch manually to get it restarted. although eclipse is lightweighted it is poor in memory management for android. using android studio is a better solution.    is their anything you are getting in your logcat?  
 considering that getsomeeasytogetboolean() and getsomehardtogetboolean() might have side-effects  all three snipets of code have different functionality and it would be an error if the compiler mixed them  
 an optimizer has to maintain the semantics of a program. so  if   and   have observable side-effects  the optimizer cant elide these side-effects as that would change the semantics of your program.    but if these action dont have observable side-effects  an optimizer will indeed perform such transformations as inlining  reordering and moving of conditionals to the beginning of a code block belong to the standard repertoire of an optimizer.    thats the reason why multi-threaded programs accessing common data structures without proper synchronization constructs can break badly as in this case a thread might observe the changed behavior of a thread executing optimized code.  
 in short  no.    it makes no sense for the  compiler  to optimise in that way  considering that the   statement may be nested within a loop  and the values of the booleans may change at runtime (after compilation  even with jit)
